"This review is about the big blunder done by Oneplus and Amazon.I ordered the 12 gb RAM variant on Oct 17 and received the 8 gb RAM variant on Oct 19. I immediately notified Amazon support and they agreed that wrong item has been sent. I asked them for replacement and they said that product is out of stock, I can add it to wishlist and once I get notified that it's available, I should call them and request for replacement. So, they delegated their job to me.It became available again in the evening of Oct 19, so I called them back and asked them to order the replacement as I wasn't able to do it on my own. I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then told to disconnect as the team wasn't available.I called them again after some time and then the service executive said that he is unable to, but his leads and managers will create a replacement request in next 1-2 minutes. Those 2 minutes never ended and I was on the call with them for more than an hour which again ended in disappointment as his so called manager was also unable to create the replacement. In the end he told me to return the device and order a new one. I asked him will I get the same offers and discounts to which he blatantly lied saying yes. But when I checked the discounts were already down from â‚¹1,750 to â‚¹1,500.I also told him that I can't use my HDFC card again and the device quantity is also limited to 1 unit per account, he advised me to either select a different color or borrow card from a friend and use another account. I was really surprised with such a fabulous piece of advice from the best customer centric company in the world.Then I asked him to escalate as he was straight away lying and trying to get rid of me, but to my surprise the next level executive also had next level IQ. She told me if I'm ready to accept the wrong variant she'll go over and beyond to compensate. I asked her what can she do, she said she'll ask her leads and call me back in 15 minutes.She did call after 15 minutes to say that we'll refund â‚¹700 to your Amazon pay account if I keep the 128 gb variant. I don't know how she calculated that difference. Everyone can see the there is a difference of â‚¹3,000 in 256 gb and 128 gb variants, but she said ""no sir, this amount is too huge for us to process"".I again gathered courage and asked her not to converse with me further and again escalate the issue. She said I'll get a call back in 24-48 hours but at the time of writing this review I've not received any calls from Amazon.Yesterday, I got an email saying that a team is working on it and need 4 working days to resolve. After committing the blunder and 3 hours of calls with the customer, they still need time.I did trust Amazon and have never faced any issues in past 5 years I've been associated with them, but this time they have really disappointed me. I accept the fact that mistakes do happen in a large supply chain but even after accepting they are not ready to do anything. The customer support executives are lying, harassing customers by making them wait longer, copy pasting standard email replies where they don't even edit the customer's name, one of the executives addressed me as ""Saleem"". So, yes their customer support is surely going downhill.I do request you all to not blindly trust these support executives for your own good. Be vigilant about the products that you order and receive.Update: Day 20 after receiving the wrong variant - Still no concrete reply from Amazon. a special executive team has been assigned for this issue who is still investigating with the seller or the warehouse and the assigned technician is out of office. First he asked me to wait for 4-5 business days, I waited and then called them again. Another executive told me the first executive is on leave so wait another 2-3 days. Then again I called after 2-3 days and same thing repeated please wait for 2-3 days. I'll continue my struggle with the best customer centric company till I get what is right.Also, I have made a decision to not purchase any expensive items from online portals who'll cheat and harass you to their heart's content and I never thought but Amazon also made it to that list for me.Update:  November 13, 2020Amazon accepted the replacement request on November 7. I had to call them for the screen replacement offer by Acko as well which was activated for the wrong variant sent. They simply refused to give that offer for the replacement and offered me â‚¹ 500 voucher for policy worth â‚¹ 1599. Mind you this company is owned by world's richest man but their executives will make every effort to con you of all they can thinking all customers are morons. Again, I had to be stern and asked them to get it activated. Finally they did activate but from the date of the dispatch of the wrong variant which again I called them to get corrected.It doesn't end here. It again took numerous calls and 6 more days to dispatch the order since they accepted the replacement request.Finally on Diwali, I received the replacement device. Made the video of unboxing the new phone as well as while handing over the 128 gb phone to the delivery guy. Can't trust these people anymore.The device works fine..as most of the owners of 8T have reviewed, cameras are just ok, its the overall UI experience which is great.But overall, it has been no less than a nightmare dealing with Amazon customer care while getting a  replacement device. Though the matter was resolved (took 27 days) I'm still disappointed to the core.Update: December 5, 2020Amazon did send a Oneplus wireless bullets headset and a â‚¹500 Amazon voucher with an apology note for this mess up. They sorted the issue with the screen replacement offer as well. I appreciate their gesture but this experience has made me much more skeptical towards buying any expensive products online.

"This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.

"1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed.

"This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions.

"Review  (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spend more time on this, so kept it and it looks good too.Pros:=> Great performance/speed=> Good battery life=> Priced good considering highend features the phone provides=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.  This may be because of this app.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.  After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. (Update: I received an oxygen OS 11.x.x update on Nov 2, and it has the fixes for heating issues, heating is considerably reduced).As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. But 16 MP front cam does a bad job when took pics from a distance in timer mode. Getting unclear pics. Selfies coming good.I can hardly find any issues with this Phone - Recommend for rough usage.

  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

  Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models.

  VERDICTDisplay - 9/10Performance - 10/10Battery - 10/10Charging - 10/10Sound & Haptics - 9/10Camera - 8/10Software - 10/10Overall - 9.5/10GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.This is my review after 8 days of use (I bought mine on the very 1st day :) of sale - 16th):I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, it is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.Those are as follows:1. Login with OnePlus account/  Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.6. In-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register (and therefore read) fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.Pros1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush issue. But I notice the green tint problem when the brightness is very low (around 10% with auto-brightness enabled) and the display seems to struggle a bit. It is random and NOT present all the time. You will notice this only in pitch dark environments. Unless this is a device-specific quality related issue, I am not too bothered because it is hardly noticeable.3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.10. Face unlock is superfast.If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures with the 8T and Nightscape is amazing. The pictures produced by the 8T are not photography perfect (when judged on specific parameters), but still great for viewing and especially for sharing on social media.

  The aquamarine green looks better than images. The display is butter smooth, I also have a Poco x2 which has 120hz smoothness is better than poco in this phone. Sd 865 handles each and every task easily no stutters at all even on pubg with hdr extreme.Haptic motor is also very good just like OnePlus 8 pro.Camera is great but not the best in this price range.Phone doesn't heat up while charging at 65w btw it fully charges in 38-39 minutes.Stereo speaker is also very good. Display is color accurate. Overall it is killer in this price... And feels premiumAnd the back is not fingerprint magnet its quite nice...  I would prefer you to buy aquamarine green.

  Camera is  the major weak point of this phone,just like it was for OnePlus 8.It seems as if OnePlus are now taking their customers for granted.Their thought.process seems to be that most customers are happy with a camera that is just above average and they shove these useless macro and depth sensors down our throats instead of a solid telephoto lens like the one on 7t.I purchased this 8t only bcos it had a flat screen and that I would anyways be using a Google camera port for the camera,because the phone excels in every other area except camera.So if camera is your top priority you would be better served with phones like galaxy s20 fe .If you are one of those tech enthusiasts who is any way going to use a gcam mod , then you can very well go for this phone and you wouldn't be dissapointed.My main issue with the camera is the Inconsistent white balance. The primary camera is capable of taking some great shots when it gets it right. OnePlus needs to up their camera image processing game.Another main issue while clicking pics is the extremely variation in white balance between regular and 2x portrait shots.For 2x portrait shots the white balance is totally off.

  Firstly compared to 7t its not at all an upgrade.Camera is average, sensors given are given in 15-20k phones.battery compared to other phones not up to the mark as given..4500mah.Brightness issues it takes time to react while you increase or decrease brightness..It also gets a bit heated...ðŸ˜±. yes heat..not at all expected from one plus..During charge it gets heated while charging, while data tranafer, wifi amd hotspot users will surely experience heating issue..Not at all advisable to buy in 43k..

  This is second mobile i have bought in first sale itself (first being moto g5 plus on flipkart)Here are the pros :1.120 Hz Fluid AMOLED Display2. 5G Snapdragon 8653. Oxygen OS 114. Android 11 (out of the box)5.65 W â€œWarp chargeâ€ (the charging is whooping fast, charger in the box)6. Type-C to Type-C Cable7. no curved screen (mayb a few like it but i don't)8. As we all know 3 years of guaranteed updates.Loaded with these features the mobile comes at 43k . With HDFC discount and exchange offer it can go down further.I think this is best mobile u can buy in this price range.

  ProsSuper fast chargingBuild qualityCons-Very bad UI-Worst dialer you can imagine.No AQI by default in weather appNo health appBasic useless calculator app*No way to record calls.No equaliser customisation available in music settings.If we talk only about UI than MiUi and Honor UI is better than OnePlus. Every app in oneplus which is available by default is useless and only a burden on your mobile because you can't uninstall these apps and you have to install another apps in replacement of these junk apps.Battery draining fast on 120hz display setting and display is less responsiveCamera blurred and not focused when you are moving fast even when you are walking.

  Â Hi,I have received a defective product. The phone gets switched off automatically after every 5-10 minutes. Battery gets completely drained within 3-4 hours without any use. Never expected such a product from One Plus. Highly disappointed as had to face such issues after paying such a high price.
"

  It is an absolute beast. The aquamarine green looks amazing in the real world. In the box, you'll receive the handset, the famous red cable, and a 65 watt power adapter along with Sim ejector tool, back cover, oneplus stickers and guides.While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.This is an early review and I think it's safe to say that this phone is not going to disappoint.This is the end. Good day everyone. Bye.

  This phone is very powerful which is clearly evident from its spec-list.Let me give some pros and cons after around a week of of usePros:* Great display (120 Hz is buttery smooth)*Flagship processor (SD 865). No lag whatsoever* Oxygen OS* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected*I didn't observe any significant heating while playing games*Solid build - Aluminum frame with glass back.*5G (although it will only useful in the future)*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1* 48 MP Main camera and wide angle camera is very good*Included case is goodCons:*I didn't like the 2MP micro camera and the chromatic camera (should have given a telephoto)

  Facing problem of extra battery drain. Apps(like yoni sbi etc) getting crashed and apps (like asphalt 9 etc) not getting downloaded from playstore..phone also having heating issues for using only for 5 min. Anyone facing same problems?

  Despite of being same camera as one plus 8 the picture quality is very poor of front camera. Battery back up is not good. Last only 7-8 hours. Now the touch is not working.
"
"
  No doubt, it's an upgrade over oneplus 8. So many features are added like 65W charger,120Hz refresh rate etc. But believe me, the quality of camera is worst. Oneplus 7 has better camera than this phone. I have been using oneplus 7 since 2 year.  Recieved this product with bubble on screen. If we remove the screen guard, then it costs around 1k for new one. Amazon supports just refused to replace this product and adviced me to visit nearest oneplus store.

  Have been using OnePlus phones for past 5+ years in the family. My last one is OnePlus 5T  which I exchanged and bought new phone OnePlus8T. Here is my review after using for more than a weekPros:Excellent and smooth 120Hz displayGaming experience is niceCons:1) Battery backup is horrible possible reasons could be phone signal keeps on varying whereas my earlier phone OnePlus5T has stable signal strength. Even otherwise battery backup is horribly wrong2) Adjusting screen brightness takes 1-2s delay to take affect3) Camera quality is not upto the mark in indoors4) while trying to make the phone 5G ready, I feel they have messed up 4G connectivity/signal things big-time.5) Alarms sometimes doesn't work properly.Review2:Battery is horribly gone wrong. Do not risk wasting your money on this product. Totally waste of your money

  Charging speed is good, battery backup and camera is average, issue in dynamic range, no night mode in front camera,needs to improve in camera, software issue also there, gallery recalculats every time all photos of the albums, and takes some time to create photos after taking shotsBlue tint when taking photos at low battery, gallery loading (recalculating), heating up, camera is average, does not get a feeling of using a premium phone paying on higher side
"
"
  Phone is good in all the features, Liked it a lot till now except the Battery Backup is not at all good if you are a continuous user of Mobile for complete whole day, you need to charge it twice/thrice a day..Rest everything is fine, Charging speed is really nice.. But never expected this low level of Battery Backup.. Disappointed ðŸ˜•Some other problems as well encountered after using it for 4 days..Not at all expected from one plusðŸ™

  Technically my fourth one plus phone (I even had the first one plus 1 not in pic). But this time it's been a let down :( .With the high refresh rates I think the phone is not able to handle the low resolution videos. There is a lot of noise in the videos. Tested on insta, YouTube, Facebook. Even tried removing the screen guard with no improvement. Not sure if this can be corrected by software.The screen is big even though narrow and one needs to use both hands playing around.Pros:Charging is fast and camera is good. And high resolution videos good.
"
"
  Awesome phone. Pros everyone are aware of. I will talk about the Cons.1. Phone heating up quite a lot. Almost every task you perform will heat up the phone.2. Camera is not up to that level. Went for OnePlus 8t instead of MI 10t for overall package but camera seems a big let down as compared to its competitor.Other than these 2 major Cons the phone is excellent in performance and call quality.Gaming in it is amazing and exciting.
"
"
  Very poor battery back up, my earlier one plus 6 and 7 devices were lasts for whole day and night, I usually charge my phone in the morning, but this device in full charge with moderate use lasts only for 12 hours, I have charged the phone and it confirms now that it takes more than one hour to charge the device from 6% to 100%, screen quality and sound quality is average, it is highly by overpriced.

  I've been owning the OnePlus 5T for almost three years. I still remember getting it from first ever sale on the November of 2017. It was one of the best looking and feeling phone of its time. Even after three years of usage, the phone still feels new and fast. It was adequate for my daily usage and the processing power was more than what I needed. I never had the temptation to update my OnePlus 5T until the day I broke the glass on my 5TðŸ˜­ðŸ’”. The phone fell straight on its face breaking the front glass of the display and the corner is chipped and has glass fragments in it. Though the touch and display has no problems, I often see shards of glass falling off from the phone which isn't safe for something which is in your pocket for most of the time. I decided it's time to change.I was initially looking to get an OnePlus 8 as I am a big fan of that curved display. The 8 was indeed a very good pick for my budget as it had everything that I needed and more. As I was reading through endless reviews of the 8, I came across a news about the rumours on the 8T. Since I had a spare phone on me, I decided to wait until the release of the 8T. On October 14, I saw the official unveil of the 8T and I initially thought the 8T wasn't a big upgrade to the 8. So I thought may be I should settle on the 8, but then I remembered what happened with my 5T. I also read that curved displays are more susceptible to damage even from small accidental drops. So I made up my mind and decided to go with the 8T.I ordered the phone through Amazon and it was delivered the very next day. The package was bigger than I expected. I didn't have much expectations during the unboxing. The aquamarine green color that I went with has a slight bluish tint to it. It isn't super reflective nor too matte. It has a very subtle gloss to it which doesn't attract too much fingerprints. Holding the phone on hand, I realised that it's a bit thicker and heavier than what I am used to (5T is the thinnest flagship made by OnePlus IMOðŸ‘€). But in-hand, it feels solid.Holding the power button, the phone came to life greeting me with the Hello screen and I started setting it up. As soon as I touched the screen, I felt that smooth 120 Hz display in action which makes the phone feel blazingly fast. This is a huge upgrade to me personally coming from 60 Hz. The Colors on the display pops and it is one of the best AMOLED panels out there. Personally, I had an issue with the 5T where the screen has a slightly warmer tint. It was showing while editing on Snapseed and Lightroom. But the 8T doesn't have any such issues. The display is spot on! I had an update waiting for me as soon as I finished the setup. It was for the camera, network and battery optimization. I updated the phone before starting to use it as anyone would like a bug free experience in a new device.The Oxygen OS 11 on top of Android 11 makes the user experience very pleasing and it is good for one handed usage for most of daily tasks. Scrolling on the 120 Hz is phenomenal and no words could describe it until you experience it in person. You would never have the heart to go back to 60 Hz. Oxygen OS 11 also offers a plethora of features such as Zen mode, Game Space, Insight Ambient display etc. They are very intuitive and enhances the user experience.Charging on the 65W Warp charger is a blissful experience even if you are coming from older OnePlus devices (Dash or Warp 30). It reaches 100% in 40 mins which is the time you'll spend on your morning routines. So you're good to go for the entire day if you just charge it in the morning. Battery life is also very good as I'm getting approximately 5 and a half hours of screen on time until the charge drops to 15%.Another major area of improvement is on the videography capabilities. Inclusion of portrait video mode, super stable mode, night mode video has made the video side of things very interesting. The edge detection on the portrait video works very well on slow moving and stationary subjects. 4k @ 60 and 1080p @ 240 has made videos so much usable as you could slow the videos on post and it could be stable than most. OIS also works very well. But, I feel the photography side of things could use a little tweaking on the image processing and overall white balance and contrast. The wide angle camera and the main sensor takes exceptional pictures in good lighting, but they struggle from over tinted greeny images on low light. It feels as if they are wearing night vision goggles. I hope this would be fixed on their next update. Inclusion of a macro lens is good, but for macro photography, I feel that you would need atleast a 12MP as the pictures look digitally over-sharpened on the 5MP unit.Over-all, it's a worthy buy for the money.

  I was using Samsung before buying this phone. But when I heard the price, it felt like its offering flagship features for midrange value, so I bought it. Have to say this that its hardware and processor is best in class, but when it comes to UI it fails miserably. The features, ease of use and customisations that One UI provides are just on next level and can't be compared with the low level and totally buggy Oxygen OS. Its almost same like stock android with slight changes which are taken from One UI. Don't buy this if your old phone is Samsung, its just downgrade.After a month :Still the worst. And one more thing I observed is it is very bad handling OTG devices like HDD and all. And also it takes lot of time to load already existing files which is a huge problem when you are trying to move around the files.* Buggy OS* Not so good with handling files* Not at all good with external devices through OTG* No extra features as in One UIFinal review, don't buy it because it's cheap. It is actually cheapest peice of garbage.

  Its been a week since am using oneplus 8T. And am facing issue from the very beginning. I had to format my phone 3 times within a week because of the issues in it after being told to do so by the customer care. First my gmail was not working. 2nd time there was problem in the play store where it was crashing again and again. 3rd time there was problem with the network where suddenly my phone stopped receiving incoming call nor i was able to do outgoing calls than i had to restart my phone that it worked and this happened atleast 2 times a day so i has to reset the network settings. Now am not able to download apps from play store which are higher than 200mb. I have attached the screenshot of the error it is showing. Now they are saying to wait for the next update because as per them this is the issue with many users, and till then i cant download apps bigger than 200 mb from playstore.This was my experience with this device . Totally disappointed and I suggest all not to buy this phone at all. Oneplus is no longer a flagship killer.

  Pro -- One of the Best Display with brightness upto 1100 nits . ( Fluid Amoled the same display Samsung uses in its S20 Ultra, it's far better than Super Amoled display)- Oxygen Os Smoothness and Speed.- Fast Charging.- Great Selfie Camera.- Vapour Chamber for Cooling.- One of the Fastest Chipset.- 120hz butter smooth Display.- Stereo Speakers.Con -- Old Camera Sensor = Though I seriously like the Camera, I got the first Update and there was a lot of improvement in overall picture quality, ofcourse If You will Compare it with IPhone definitely You will find some thing missing. Overall the Cameras are awesome, it satisfied My needs.### For those Who are comparing it with Samsung S20 FE, Google Pixel 4a and Mi10T Pro ###> Samsung S20 FE - It has Exynos(4G), which is Trash and there's no way it can compete it with the SD865 (5G).> Google Pixel 4a - Poor battery life, heating issues, Plastic body, Small Screen, Cameras are good but You can't Zoom in due to Low Pixels, hangs or heats up too much while doing heavy task or while gaming or while using multiple social media apps.> Mi10T Pro - Bad display ( only IPS LCD no AMOLED), MIUI contains too much Advertisements ( everytime You install or open or even use the Phone an advertisement will pop-up from nowhere), Poor Cooling management for 144hz gaming.==== At this Price Point You wont get a better Phone with SD865, Fast Charging, Great display, Oxygen OS smoothness and a lot more  ===

  Received on 18th Oct 2020. 1+2, 1+3,1+5,1+6t n now 1+8t. Oxygen OS is too good and never had any reason to switch to any other brands.Battery back up is good for a day.Considered Mi10t pro but only good thing about that phone may be that 108mp camera.Stuck to 1+ mainly coz of the almost stock android experience.Built quality is good, stereo speakers now sound excellent, volume is adequate.Always on display is a boon.Camera quality is good for daily photography n all. If I need dslr quality photos, I would use a Dslr.Charging is lighting fast with new 65w charger.This is definitely not a flagship model but it was a good phone to upgrade from 6T.Sold off my back up iPhone 6S as exchange for 1+8t ðŸ˜†. If any queries, drop me a message. Will update after further usage.

  I got it on16th October via one day delivery.So after using 3 days I am writing this review.As far as the display, it is very smooth we can really feel the difference between 60hz screen & 120hz screen. We can easily look at the screen clearly even in the sunlight, thanks to one plus for increasing brightness nits upto 1090. So display is very smooth, you will love it.Also, the latest processor SD865 performs very good. I played COD Mobile. The experience was awesome. Gaming was smooth. It also comes with Game Space that allows us to play games peacefully. While gaming or charging it heats a little but which is negligible as temp. (39-41 deg. Celcius) is very low as compared to other devices.Camera is very good. But there is not latest sensor. If provided it could be great. But difference is noticable only when you zoom image to final level or you are a camera freak.It is almost as good as OP8, I have to say a little better than OP8. But not better than OP8 Pro. But a normal person like me who uses camera occasionally, it does not make any difference.I prefer latest processor and display.It also includes Oxygen OS & Android 11 out of the box which makes it again more interesting due to its awesome features.And this all comes at a price of 42999/- only.I got it for 39000/- at AGIF Sale.So it is a great deal at 42999/-.

  Everything is great about the phone except the heating issue. It became quite hot during initial setup and remains warm on normal usage also all the time at the top railing and around camera.I have installed CPU Z and Cpu monitor appns and saw a constant cpu temp of 42 to 55 Â°C and battery temperature of upto 42Â°CHave requested Amazon technician checkup!Update:Got a replacement unit, and it heated upto 70Â°C, recorded by CPU monitor.Finally had to return my order. A million thanks to Amazon for being such a grt customer centric company!

  Superb in this price segment.Pros:-1) 65W Fast Charging2) Camera setup (top left side)3)  Build QualityCons:-1) Weight is not equally distributed, heavy in down side of device2) Processor need improvement3) 90Hz refresh rate options not available only 60 and 120Hz available4) Display ( OnePlus 8 have batter then 8T )5) Design ( Not feel premium in hand must give in curved display )This review after use 2 day of uses and i am used it very hardly its battery backup is around 7-8 hours of heavy use like YouTube, Call of duty etc. But if you are light user then it will provide you 13-14 hours battery backup. If you want 5G and 65W charger then please go for it you never disappoint or regret for this device.

  I ordered it within 10 seconds of opening of the sale and received delivery on very next day. No issue in delivery. But it seems expensive and over priced. One plus 8 is more impressive in looks and more sleek. One plus 8t disappointed me in matter of looks, overall performance is ok but it drain bettery very fast  no doubt charger is very fast.Nothing new in it and at this price tag people expect more inovative but this time OnePlus disappointed me because of looks, thickness and body finish of oneus 8t. I am not happy with this purchase.

  Display Okay: Nothing premiumCamera: Basic, Oneplus 6T does a better job than thisProcessing: Fast, experienced no lag what so ever in general operation. Did not play heavy games.Battery: Charges super fast, drains faster.Battery Backup: It is a sham! If you have older variants of oneplus, do not upgrade it for this one. Battery backup is horrible and you will have to charge 4-5 times a day even for medium usage. You will not get more than 4 hours even if you browse social media apps.Heating issues: Heating issues are very prominent on this device, never faced that with my oneplus 6T. The software update has also not helped with both: bad battery and heating issues.Highlight of the phone: You will get low intensity electric shock when you hold the phone near the volume buttons, also near the switch ON/OFF buttons and near the speaker at the bottom near the charging spot. I have to maneuver my hands skillfully to not feel those low intensity shock vibrations! Didn't know I needed to be low key institutionalized!

  Buy only if you have older model of phones. Warp charging is really blazing fast. Sound quality is excellent. Nothing looks practically new with 120hz refresh rate or Oxygen OS11 based on Android 11. I was already using OnePlus 7 and hence don't feel any major update in OnePlus 8T.On the contrary, I am unable to publish anything on OnePlus community as the phone gets hanged while publishing post. Also I can't update OnePlus Gallery app in play Store as all the time it  says there is some problem in update.Features like variety of navigation gestures, sms category byfurcation are much more better in OnePlus 7 than this phone. Hopefully OnePlus restores these features in OTA updates soon..Editing my review after OTA update: Finally able to install OnePlus Gallery app, MAadhar app and banking apps. Thank God it's fixed. Still, camera quality is not upto the mark. If you are a sound lover and crazy about sound quality, you can go for it.Would like to repeat myself: Go for it only if you really have very older version of phones.

  Â A great handset from OnePlus again!Pros:Warp Charging - 0-100 in 35-40minFlat DisplayPerformance with SD 865Very good sound qualityVideo stabilization is awesome!Cons:Playstore is having some issues while downloading some specific apps. Those apps are not getting installed. Many users have reported it. They will fix it next update mostly.Battery backup is average. 5-6 hours SOT in 120Hz refresh rate.Camera is just above average. Night mode is good.

  I've been waiting for this phone's release from one month because I didn't want to buy One Plus 8 because of the curved display and..I was not disappointed...-*Display* is awesome...better than one plus 8 because I've heard that they've improved the brightness levels-*120Hz Refresh rate*....although 90hz is more than enough but in gaming and some other areas 120hz will be usefull...-*4500mah battery* is enough for our daily usage but ...you know 120hz will drain the battery faster when compared with 60hz and 90hz ..but you'll get 5-6 hours screen time easily in 120hz too-*65W charging*...woah full charging in less than 45 min ... I've kept charging at 1:10am at 18% and started surfing Instagram by the time 1:50am it was 99%..lol..-*Cameras*... I've shared some samples.. pls don't judge by those photo's because I've captured those pics 5mim before writing this review only..but they came pretty good..those were just clicked casually..but if you use them properly you'll get better pics..and they've improved the camera software and Ive heard it is better than one plus 8... they've improved ultra wide and macro camera also-*Oxygen OS*..you know Oxygen OS is awesome..I've upgraded from MiUI and I can find so much difference..no ads at all and clean software..no blotware...they have even removed Facebook lol..only Google apps and Amazon were pre installed...You can even buy oneplus phones for Oxygen OS only..it is that good-*Gaming*.. Snapdragon 865 will handle almost every game pretty well.. battery drain is also less while I'm playing Pubg and other games-Phone is very good looking and very comfortable to carry  Finally I'm happy with my purchase and specs wise it is better than OnePlus 8..But it is your wish because some feel curved display are more premium so if you like curved display you can take one plus 8..but if you're ok with any type of screen then you should definitely pick 8T over 8 ....because 8T has better specs in almost every aspect

  I have brought 8t lunar silver color and below is the my first impression.Pros -1) It feels very premium and light in weight2) UI is super fast and smooth3) Decent camearCons -1) It is observed phone heats up to some extent near camera module in normal uses as well2) It takes some time to load images in gallery or load icons once phone boots up. Seems to be storage or software issue.3) Battery gets drain very fast even though with normal uses. Yesterday I hardly able to get backup of 10 hrsBattery is the main concern to worry however I will be checking this for one more day and then decide to keep it or return

  One plus just loosing it's image. This is my first one plus phone and I got disappointed from this. Lots of software issues I am facing from this phone.Camera quality is just like a 20k phone. Battery is very much poor , do not last for atleast a single day. It must be around 5500 mah with this drainage of battery. I am unable to update one plus gallery, everytime is shows software error.Can't use stock android experience. Where the hell is oxygen OS, its very poor. My older vivo nex was far better in terms of software and UI.Call recording function not available, I can't understand simply 10k phones now a days have it.IMX 586 is outdated still they are using it in T version. One plus Nord and this device got almost same primary camera. My 2nd SIM is running on 4G or not, it is not showing. The same DDR4 , atleast this can be improved. What is meaning of T version.Camera 6/10.Battery 5/10Display 8/10Performance 9/10Software and UI 4/10Charging 10/10

  Very poor quality..so much heating problem. I have complaint about this but still amazon not resolved the issue. I have also contacted to one plus customer care but same response. I feel amazon is only for selling product not for service. Now unable to contact amazon team.

  Clean look...UI is great..battery is mediocare... getting around 5.30 hrs of talktym with 120hz ,wifi and both sim on 4g...gaming is smooth at highest graphics.. doesn't feel any heating issue while charging...camera is good for day light photos..but in indoors it just put more light and doesn't focus on image quality..so overall decent package...can give 3..(less for only camera,mediocare battery)One new problem I found with the screen .is that if you apply a pressure little bit to screen . screen tends to show a grey circle near volume button..never faced this issue in samsung

  Satisfied with the Phone Build Quality, Charging Speed, Display, Battery Backup and you name it. Camera quality is good and I have seen some videos comparing it with Samsung S20FE and iPhone 11. Those mobile costs 6k more than OnePlus 8T and camera quality difference is negligible. Of course FT and 11 does better job in some condition but in some OnePlus 8T is best. Instead of Macro and Monochrome in 8T they could have went with Telephoto lens but hey you cant have all right configuration in a smartphone and if it does people wont buy OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8Pro. The main camera sensor used in OnePlus8T is same as OnePlus 7 till OnePlus 8Pro. so that's 2 year old hardware but its best at what it is.  Anyway there is always GCam mod and you can use that to take pics. Worth the Price. Go for it.

  Bought Aqua Marine model, This is my first experience with One Plus device, and I have really been disappointed so far, the phone heats up on regular calls, while playing music and other stuffs, the battery drain is very bad. I am getting maximum screen on time of 4hrs.With 4500mAh battery I expected a lot more. This is acting like a 10-15k phone, even those phone do not heat so easily nowadays. Main Camera is Good same as Nord.The display at 120hz is the only plus point, speaker is also good, two cameras are just for show you can cover the two lenses and still take the Macro Photos with the main sensor.I will probably return the phone I am very disappointed. While writing this review the phone has started heating up.Also to mention it's very hectic task to get the phone returned. Bad bad experience with both Amazon and OnePlus 8TI have also shared the battery drain screenshots. Hope it helps to other shoppers.

  Extra ordinary on one side, terrible on the other.Pros:1. Good display with 120 Hz sceeen. Simply stunning.2. Super fast processor and OS. Though Android 11 has some glitches, I'm sure OP will fix them soon.3. Aesthetically designed well, weight distribution is uniform & handling the phone is way easier thanks to the flat screen.4. Load speaker is good though the bottom speaker is loader making the steteo experience little awkward at times. But never mind, they're good.5. The haptic feedback of the vibration motar is good and feels premium6. Build quality is top notch. The camera bump looks way better in reality than in the picturesCons1. Oh god, what a horrible camera. It's pathetic. I previously used OP6 and felt even that 3 year old phone does a similar job at clicking below par pictures.2. Why make a glass phone if you don't want to include wireless charging. Specially in 2020, at 46k? Its like spending money on an expensive suit and not buy shoes but wear flip flops! HuhConclusion: it's a decent phone but I feel OP got it all wrong with the pricing and features of their 3 phones. The Nord, regular and the pro series. The OP Pro at almost 14k more expensive than the regular isn't worth it for what it offers. But again, is the One plus regular worth over the nord at almost 20k premium? 765G processor is just as good is what I've heard. If you can wait, please don't buy 8T or 8 Pro. Wait for 9.Dear OP, instead of cutting down on ""not so expensive stuff"" on your regular versions, please try to create something new for your Pro versions that would make them worthy of buying.q

  A great phone at this price. The back main camera pictures are nice but they should improve the front camera specially provide night mode. Battery life is good and last throughout the day. It gets a little warm sometimes, note I don't play heavy games much and there is a hollow feeling at the back of the phone when speakers are on. But overall I'm happy with my decision and the performance of the phone is undoubtedly great.

  Reviewing it after 2 weeks of use:Pros:1. Charging speed - Outstanding (20-100% in ~30 minutes)2. Display and touch - Excellent (120Hz is frigging awesome!)3. The hardware in general is really good4. Fingerprint Scanner -  Fast as hell5. No green tint issues on display6. Phone barely heats while charging7. Phone barely heats while gaming8. Even the lowest brightness shows excellent blacks.Cons:1. Average camera - Photos in good light are excellent, but photos taken at lowlight/using nightscape sucks. However, if you use Pro mode (or Gcam), the quality is excellent. That shows that the camera lenses are fine, it's the stock camera software that's bad.2. Poor battery life on dark mode - If you use dark theme, your phone almost always gonna be at 120Hz, resulting in below average battery life. It doesn't dynamically switch the refresh rate on dark mode. However, if you use light theme for the system, the battery is good. This is a clear software issue. Samsung S20 FE with similar specs gets 9hours SOT at 120Hz. We get barely 5.5 hours on dark mode. That's bad. This is due to the dynamic refresh rate switching not working on dark mode.PS: Got 2 updates in the 2 weeks that I started using my phone, which were supposed to fix power optimization and camera quality. No noticeable difference came.Verdict: Good phone with a great hardware and poor software.If you are good at rooting and custom roms flashing, wait for custom roms to come and use those. In the meantime, you can root and flash custom kernels. That actually improved my SOT. Even though OxygenOS is clean looking, it's just the look. The performance is bad.

  I have been using Redmi Note 4 from past 3 years and moving to Oneplus 8T is such an amazing experience. Everything is best in this phone. Although it's little pricy, its completely worth it for the experience it providesSome of the best features i cant ignore1) Blazing fast fingerprint and face unlock2) 120hz refresh rate gives a very smooth and fast experience3) 4k video recording4) 12GB RAM and 865 Qualcomm Snapdragon so that you never compromise on performance at any cost5) 1080 HD displayðŸ˜ƒAll over above...man, the charging....charges like a flash,ðŸ˜…

  Being used to OnePlus family of devices right from the One to Five to now 8T, it's been a journey of change, bigger screens, fast to ultra fast charging, however the camera could've been better!+120Hz is slick, you may not want to go back to 60Hz+Warp charge 65 is blazing fast, and the bottom doesn't heat up as well+Display is nice and pleasing+Droid 11 out of the box, however Oxygen OS has the biggest change by deviating from stock Android to customisations (some would like it while some wouldn't)+Buttery smooth OS, works like a charm-Some customisations are really good use-battery lasts for a day and more based on usage, but with the warp charge, you never run out of power+Cooling system is too good, you never feel too much heat even after long hours of use or gaming+Always on is a nice feature and I love the Canvas-Camera is good but nothing evolutionary, OP needs to work in this areas on hardware rather than always tweaking the algorithms-Some apps are not customized to 120Hz refresh and may act weird-OS design seems to be heavily influenced from Samsung, OP can do better on their own and do good-Elegant design nevertheless, nothing groundbreaking-Might feel a tad heavy for someLastly,Aquamarine green looks lovely in the hand, worth picking it up over the SilverOp7t users and above can wait for Op9

  I have purchased this phone with 12gb Ram & 256gb storage, it's also available with 8gb varient. Oneplus T version phone are always good. Oneplus 8 or 8pro has some display and heating issue but this is goodGood part1. Phone charging is very very fast. Charge in 30-40min to 100%2. Decent camera3. It comes with phone cover and temperad glass4. This phone looks like premium quality.5. Snapdragon 865 processor ðŸ˜Bad part1. I feel this phone little hot during transferring the phone date from old phone to this one. But it's not all the time. Now it's working well.2. Camera could have been little better. Oneplus need to workon it. Samsung S20 FE has better camera.If someone do not want to buy this phone then I will suggest them.Samsung S20 FE or Mi10T ProThese set are with same range and almost same configuration.I did't not go with Samsung S20FE beacuse it has shitty processor which is octa-core Samsung Exynos 990.

  Here is the review of my own device.Starting with the screen-1. Beautiful amoled panel with accurate colours.2. 120hz display is lit.3. Brightness goes really high, didn't face any problem while using on direct sunlight.4. Flat screen is more secure than curve.Performance-1. Snapdragon 865, lag free experiences.2. In Day to day use, no problem.Camera -1. Sony imx586 is here, pictures are lil saturated.2. Nightscape is great.3. Video quality is good enough and stable too.Looks n feel-1. This have glass back so its too slippery. (Use protective case, use soft case)2. The colour aquamarine green is sick. This one is glossy. My friend bought the lunar silver one, that's matte finish.Summary-Great performance, good enough camera and the 65watt charge is also fast it takes max 44-45min to charge 0-100% . *Oneplus give software update fast to upgrade ta camera quality*

  Writing this review after 10 days using one plus 8t- Display is awesome you can surely experience120hz display refresh- Battery charges 0-100% within one hour 65w charging blows your mind- Battery life is good since I'm a moderate user it's lasts upto one day for me- Camera quality is good but can be best if camera is primary concern you can go with samsung at this price point- Awesome performance since it has Qualcomm 865- Gaming experience with 120hz and 865 you won't regret- Oxygen os gives you stock android and custom experience lag free and smooth- Built quality is also good- No issues with network reception- No display issues with my device- Indisplay fingerprint reader is faster and accurateComing to cons- Camera could be slightly better but I'm satisfied with this as my primary concern is performance

  Coming from OnePlus 6 I had a great expectations from OnePlus 8t. But after purchase I regretting it. OnePlus 6 was far much better than 8t. 8t has a pathetic camera quality. Imagine a flagship PHN having a pathetic camera. Signal reception quality is not satisfactory, my mom's realms 5 pro gives better network reception quality than this overhyped 8t. Overall not satisfied at all.

  Updated review:After Oxygen Os 11.0.5.6 update, the stock camera very equal quality to gcam. No issues with my phone. Great phone for 44250 rupees price.Old review:I m planning to buy iphone 11 but after launching 8t I decided to buy 8t because of display, charging speed, performance, higher internal storage for lower price.Pros1.amazing screen without any issues2. battery, SOT is above 8 hrs3. Performance4. Camera with great photos and great night mode-  I was using gcam and sd865 processing is great for gcam and stock camera photos also.5. Front camera also good6. Oxygen os 117. Charging- 15 to 100% in 32 minutesCons.1. Price is little bit higher. If they priced under 40k then it will be great deal.Verdict:If you want allrounder phone definitely go for it of 256gb variant because if you use this phone long term usage then definitely need high storage.

  This OP8T is beast. Overall every of your single task, multi task, camera performance, gaming and everything is best in it.. most of all I'm game lover, loved to play pubg in it..ðŸ˜ You'll never get disappointed by this beast.. I've come along from Samsung A50.. I've seen a lots of changes, the 120hz display gives you the buttery smooth while scrolling news feed or using any of the system. Just in love with this flagship killer device.Snapdragon 865 just killing it.. you won't get enough in other.. just go for it blindly..ðŸ¥° mine took only 5 days to arrive at my place and I'm happy with it.. device's mind blowing..

  Right of the bat, I would like to list the slightly bad thing about the phone which is pretty much the camera. It does the job though. It's a pretty decent camera which will practically do anything you might want to do in your day to day use. If you just want to professionally shoot pictures, just buy a camera.Now that the camera is out of the way, I think there is nothing where OnePlus is lacking. The display is absolutely gorgeous (and it's FLAT). The bezels are thin and sweet. The performance is absolutely crushing any other phone in this range (at par with the flagships). The feel of the phone in the hand and looks are just great. The 120Hz feels very smooth. And finally, the Oxygen OS is gorgeous.I would say if you are looking for a phone which has the best camera, this is not it. But if you are okay with a decent camera, this phone is an absolute beast everywhere else.

  My experience:Fingerprint reader- goodCamera quality- good (not very impressive but in terms of OnePlus cameras over a past series of phones , it's getting better ""my thought"") and also there is somany features in camera section which can consume your time with phone.Processor- impressive speed with new2.86 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-core Processor + Adreno 650 GPU ,Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system.Display- my previous phone was poco F1 so my comparison comes with a limited sight. So, very smooth........120 Hz gives us a smooth experience.Weight- light weightDesign- as always classy design from OnePlus.Battery- 4500 mah battery is not bad while watching videos even in 120 hz it gives us more time for continuous watch. But, I noticed something when I play games. I played a lot of games. I spend more time with ' pubg ' than other games. So when I started playing pubg in my fully charged OnePlus 8T , condition was good. Battery is steady and it takes time to get drain. But after continuous use, heating problem arises and battery drains fast ( after 30 - 50 minutes of usage ).Gaming- other than battery drainage gaming was awesome.Warp Charger- very fast I mean realy realy fast.Note :There is no 3.5 mm audio jack. So you should wait again for the arrival of audio jack converter unless you already have c type headset .My overall experience was nice with OnePlus 8T but battery is still a problem as a gamer hope they will fix this issue with upcoming series........

  Purchased One Plus 8T as an upgrade to my One Plus 5, which I have been using for 3 years. Had high expectations but Super disappointed with this latest offering from One Plus.1. Poor Network stability - My airtel sim faced constant disruptions while connecting to internet. (Was smooth in One Plus 5 at the same area). Used to keep my OnePlus 5 as a hotspot to no issues but 8T gave constant disruptions.2. Less than impressive Battery life - Although battery gets charged to 100% in less than 40 mins, it gets drained fast as well. Charging speed is great owing to the 65w warp charger (My one Plus 5 charged faster as well)3. Okayish Camera - Nothing special or great to be said to be camera as well. Expected a better camera at this price range.Looks like One Plus is focussing on Nord this year, putting their least efforts in a very mediocre 8T.The only pros are 120 Hz refresh rate ( which drains the battery) and the high RAM and storage options the phone provides.There is no tap & pay option and wireless charging option, which is expected at this price range.Suggest to look for other options at this price range or wait for better ones than going for 8T. There is no Return option for the phone as well.Highly disappointed, One Plus! Probably the worst phone by One Plus. My One Plus 5 fared better.

  I ordered the phone with 7 minutes after the launch @ Amazon - I have received the product by next day- Packaging and delivery was pretty fast and good as usual.Post unboxing - Phone display and performance are really awesome  12GB + 256 GB storage - 120 Hz display gives the complete ultra smooth display.Battery remains for a day and half - 27 hrs with Wifi on.Camera quality - 4.5 / 5Display - 5/5Battery - 4.3/5Finally  the Oneplus 8T is a great flagship from Oneplus - Thanks for the Nice Design!

  Great product.If you are still confused between OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8T,then take a deep breath and go for 8T.Very very smooth.Camera needs some improvement.Warp charge 65 is just outstanding.120hz refresh rate is just fantastic.Snapdragon 865 does it's job very well.Complete beast.It does not has any display issues like 8 and 8 pro.

  This review is about the big blunder done by Oneplus and Amazon.I ordered the 12 gb RAM variant on Oct 17 and received the 8 gb RAM variant on Oct 19. I immediately notified Amazon support and they agreed that wrong item has been sent. I asked them for replacement and they said that product is out of stock, I can add it to wishlist and once I get notified that it's available, I should call them and request for replacement. So, they delegated their job to me.It became available again in the evening of Oct 19, so I called them back and asked them to order the replacement as I wasn't able to do it on my own. I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then told to disconnect as the team wasn't available.I called them again after some time and then the service executive said that he is unable to, but his leads and managers will create a replacement request in next 1-2 minutes. Those 2 minutes never ended and I was on the call with them for more than an hour which again ended in disappointment as his so called manager was also unable to create the replacement. In the end he told me to return the device and order a new one. I asked him will I get the same offers and discounts to which he blatantly lied saying yes. But when I checked the discounts were already down from â‚¹1,750 to â‚¹1,500.I also told him that I can't use my HDFC card again and the device quantity is also limited to 1 unit per account, he advised me to either select a different color or borrow card from a friend and use another account. I was really surprised with such a fabulous piece of advice from the best customer centric company in the world.Then I asked him to escalate as he was straight away lying and trying to get rid of me, but to my surprise the next level executive also had next level IQ. She told me if I'm ready to accept the wrong variant she'll go over and beyond to compensate. I asked her what can she do, she said she'll ask her leads and call me back in 15 minutes.She did call after 15 minutes to say that we'll refund â‚¹700 to your Amazon pay account if I keep the 128 gb variant. I don't know how she calculated that difference. Everyone can see the there is a difference of â‚¹3,000 in 256 gb and 128 gb variants, but she said ""no sir, this amount is too huge for us to process"".I again gathered courage and asked her not to converse with me further and again escalate the issue. She said I'll get a call back in 24-48 hours but at the time of writing this review I've not received any calls from Amazon.Yesterday, I got an email saying that a team is working on it and need 4 working days to resolve. After committing the blunder and 3 hours of calls with the customer, they still need time.I did trust Amazon and have never faced any issues in past 5 years I've been associated with them, but this time they have really disappointed me. I accept the fact that mistakes do happen in a large supply chain but even after accepting they are not ready to do anything. The customer support executives are lying, harassing customers by making them wait longer, copy pasting standard email replies where they don't even edit the customer's name, one of the executives addressed me as ""Saleem"". So, yes their customer support is surely going downhill.I do request you all to not blindly trust these support executives for your own good. Be vigilant about the products that you order and receive.Update: Day 20 after receiving the wrong variant - Still no concrete reply from Amazon. a special executive team has been assigned for this issue who is still investigating with the seller or the warehouse and the assigned technician is out of office. First he asked me to wait for 4-5 business days, I waited and then called them again. Another executive told me the first executive is on leave so wait another 2-3 days. Then again I called after 2-3 days and same thing repeated please wait for 2-3 days. I'll continue my struggle with the best customer centric company till I get what is right.Also, I have made a decision to not purchase any expensive items from online portals who'll cheat and harass you to their heart's content and I never thought but Amazon also made it to that list for me.Update:  November 13, 2020Amazon accepted the replacement request on November 7. I had to call them for the screen replacement offer by Acko as well which was activated for the wrong variant sent. They simply refused to give that offer for the replacement and offered me â‚¹ 500 voucher for policy worth â‚¹ 1599. Mind you this company is owned by world's richest man but their executives will make every effort to con you of all they can thinking all customers are morons. Again, I had to be stern and asked them to get it activated. Finally they did activate but from the date of the dispatch of the wrong variant which again I called them to get corrected.It doesn't end here. It again took numerous calls and 6 more days to dispatch the order since they accepted the replacement request.Finally on Diwali, I received the replacement device. Made the video of unboxing the new phone as well as while handing over the 128 gb phone to the delivery guy. Can't trust these people anymore.The device works fine..as most of the owners of 8T have reviewed, cameras are just ok, its the overall UI experience which is great.But overall, it has been no less than a nightmare dealing with Amazon customer care while getting a  replacement device. Though the matter was resolved (took 27 days) I'm still disappointed to the core.Update: December 5, 2020Amazon did send a Oneplus wireless bullets headset and a â‚¹500 Amazon voucher with an apology note for this mess up. They sorted the issue with the screen replacement offer as well. I appreciate their gesture but this experience has made me much more skeptical towards buying any expensive products online.

  This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.

  1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed.

  This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions.

  Review  (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spend more time on this, so kept it and it looks good too.Pros:=> Great performance/speed=> Good battery life=> Priced good considering highend features the phone provides=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.  This may be because of this app.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.  After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. (Update: I received an oxygen OS 11.x.x update on Nov 2, and it has the fixes for heating issues, heating is considerably reduced).As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. But 16 MP front cam does a bad job when took pics from a distance in timer mode. Getting unclear pics. Selfies coming good.I can hardly find any issues with this Phone - Recommend for rough usage.

  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

  Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models.

  This review is about the big blunder done by Oneplus and Amazon.I ordered the 12 gb RAM variant on Oct 17 and received the 8 gb RAM variant on Oct 19. I immediately notified Amazon support and they agreed that wrong item has been sent. I asked them for replacement and they said that product is out of stock, I can add it to wishlist and once I get notified that it's available, I should call them and request for replacement. So, they delegated their job to me.It became available again in the evening of Oct 19, so I called them back and asked them to order the replacement as I wasn't able to do it on my own. I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then told to disconnect as the team wasn't available.I called them again after some time and then the service executive said that he is unable to, but his leads and managers will create a replacement request in next 1-2 minutes. Those 2 minutes never ended and I was on the call with them for more than an hour which again ended in disappointment as his so called manager was also unable to create the replacement. In the end he told me to return the device and order a new one. I asked him will I get the same offers and discounts to which he blatantly lied saying yes. But when I checked the discounts were already down from â‚¹1,750 to â‚¹1,500.I also told him that I can't use my HDFC card again and the device quantity is also limited to 1 unit per account, he advised me to either select a different color or borrow card from a friend and use another account. I was really surprised with such a fabulous piece of advice from the best customer centric company in the world.Then I asked him to escalate as he was straight away lying and trying to get rid of me, but to my surprise the next level executive also had next level IQ. She told me if I'm ready to accept the wrong variant she'll go over and beyond to compensate. I asked her what can she do, she said she'll ask her leads and call me back in 15 minutes.She did call after 15 minutes to say that we'll refund â‚¹700 to your Amazon pay account if I keep the 128 gb variant. I don't know how she calculated that difference. Everyone can see the there is a difference of â‚¹3,000 in 256 gb and 128 gb variants, but she said ""no sir, this amount is too huge for us to process"".I again gathered courage and asked her not to converse with me further and again escalate the issue. She said I'll get a call back in 24-48 hours but at the time of writing this review I've not received any calls from Amazon.Yesterday, I got an email saying that a team is working on it and need 4 working days to resolve. After committing the blunder and 3 hours of calls with the customer, they still need time.I did trust Amazon and have never faced any issues in past 5 years I've been associated with them, but this time they have really disappointed me. I accept the fact that mistakes do happen in a large supply chain but even after accepting they are not ready to do anything. The customer support executives are lying, harassing customers by making them wait longer, copy pasting standard email replies where they don't even edit the customer's name, one of the executives addressed me as ""Saleem"". So, yes their customer support is surely going downhill.I do request you all to not blindly trust these support executives for your own good. Be vigilant about the products that you order and receive.Update: Day 20 after receiving the wrong variant - Still no concrete reply from Amazon. a special executive team has been assigned for this issue who is still investigating with the seller or the warehouse and the assigned technician is out of office. First he asked me to wait for 4-5 business days, I waited and then called them again. Another executive told me the first executive is on leave so wait another 2-3 days. Then again I called after 2-3 days and same thing repeated please wait for 2-3 days. I'll continue my struggle with the best customer centric company till I get what is right.Also, I have made a decision to not purchase any expensive items from online portals who'll cheat and harass you to their heart's content and I never thought but Amazon also made it to that list for me.Update:  November 13, 2020Amazon accepted the replacement request on November 7. I had to call them for the screen replacement offer by Acko as well which was activated for the wrong variant sent. They simply refused to give that offer for the replacement and offered me â‚¹ 500 voucher for policy worth â‚¹ 1599. Mind you this company is owned by world's richest man but their executives will make every effort to con you of all they can thinking all customers are morons. Again, I had to be stern and asked them to get it activated. Finally they did activate but from the date of the dispatch of the wrong variant which again I called them to get corrected.It doesn't end here. It again took numerous calls and 6 more days to dispatch the order since they accepted the replacement request.Finally on Diwali, I received the replacement device. Made the video of unboxing the new phone as well as while handing over the 128 gb phone to the delivery guy. Can't trust these people anymore.The device works fine..as most of the owners of 8T have reviewed, cameras are just ok, its the overall UI experience which is great.But overall, it has been no less than a nightmare dealing with Amazon customer care while getting a  replacement device. Though the matter was resolved (took 27 days) I'm still disappointed to the core.Update: December 5, 2020Amazon did send a Oneplus wireless bullets headset and a â‚¹500 Amazon voucher with an apology note for this mess up. They sorted the issue with the screen replacement offer as well. I appreciate their gesture but this experience has made me much more skeptical towards buying any expensive products online.

  This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.

  1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed.

  This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions.

  Review  (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spend more time on this, so kept it and it looks good too.Pros:=> Great performance/speed=> Good battery life=> Priced good considering highend features the phone provides=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.  This may be because of this app.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.  After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. (Update: I received an oxygen OS 11.x.x update on Nov 2, and it has the fixes for heating issues, heating is considerably reduced).As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. But 16 MP front cam does a bad job when took pics from a distance in timer mode. Getting unclear pics. Selfies coming good.I can hardly find any issues with this Phone - Recommend for rough usage.

  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

  VERDICTDisplay - 9/10Performance - 10/10Battery - 10/10Charging - 10/10Sound & Haptics - 9/10Camera - 8/10Software - 10/10Overall - 9.5/10GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.This is my review after 8 days of use (I bought mine on the very 1st day :) of sale - 16th):I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, it is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.Those are as follows:1. Login with OnePlus account/  Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.6. In-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register (and therefore read) fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.Pros1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush issue. But I notice the green tint problem when the brightness is very low (around 10% with auto-brightness enabled) and the display seems to struggle a bit. It is random and NOT present all the time. You will notice this only in pitch dark environments. Unless this is a device-specific quality related issue, I am not too bothered because it is hardly noticeable.3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.10. Face unlock is superfast.If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures with the 8T and Nightscape is amazing. The pictures produced by the 8T are not photography perfect (when judged on specific parameters), but still great for viewing and especially for sharing on social media.

  The aquamarine green looks better than images. The display is butter smooth, I also have a Poco x2 which has 120hz smoothness is better than poco in this phone. Sd 865 handles each and every task easily no stutters at all even on pubg with hdr extreme.Haptic motor is also very good just like OnePlus 8 pro.Camera is great but not the best in this price range.Phone doesn't heat up while charging at 65w btw it fully charges in 38-39 minutes.Stereo speaker is also very good. Display is color accurate. Overall it is killer in this price... And feels premiumAnd the back is not fingerprint magnet its quite nice...  I would prefer you to buy aquamarine green.

  Camera is  the major weak point of this phone,just like it was for OnePlus 8.It seems as if OnePlus are now taking their customers for granted.Their thought.process seems to be that most customers are happy with a camera that is just above average and they shove these useless macro and depth sensors down our throats instead of a solid telephoto lens like the one on 7t.I purchased this 8t only bcos it had a flat screen and that I would anyways be using a Google camera port for the camera,because the phone excels in every other area except camera.So if camera is your top priority you would be better served with phones like galaxy s20 fe .If you are one of those tech enthusiasts who is any way going to use a gcam mod , then you can very well go for this phone and you wouldn't be dissapointed.My main issue with the camera is the Inconsistent white balance. The primary camera is capable of taking some great shots when it gets it right. OnePlus needs to up their camera image processing game.Another main issue while clicking pics is the extremely variation in white balance between regular and 2x portrait shots.For 2x portrait shots the white balance is totally off.
"
"
  Firstly compared to 7t its not at all an upgrade.Camera is average, sensors given are given in 15-20k phones.battery compared to other phones not up to the mark as given..4500mah.Brightness issues it takes time to react while you increase or decrease brightness..It also gets a bit heated...ðŸ˜±. yes heat..not at all expected from one plus..During charge it gets heated while charging, while data tranafer, wifi amd hotspot users will surely experience heating issue..Not at all advisable to buy in 43k..

  This is second mobile i have bought in first sale itself (first being moto g5 plus on flipkart)Here are the pros :1.120 Hz Fluid AMOLED Display2. 5G Snapdragon 8653. Oxygen OS 114. Android 11 (out of the box)5.65 W â€œWarp chargeâ€ (the charging is whooping fast, charger in the box)6. Type-C to Type-C Cable7. no curved screen (mayb a few like it but i don't)8. As we all know 3 years of guaranteed updates.Loaded with these features the mobile comes at 43k . With HDFC discount and exchange offer it can go down further.I think this is best mobile u can buy in this price range.

Every app in oneplus which is available by default is useless and only a burden on your mobile because you can't uninstall these apps and you have to install another apps in replacement of these junk apps.Battery draining fast on 120hz display setting and display is less responsiveCamera blurred and not focused when you are moving fast even when you are walking.

  Â Hi,I have received a defective product. The phone gets switched off automatically after every 5-10 minutes. Battery gets completely drained within 3-4 hours without any use. Never expected such a product from One Plus. Highly disappointed as had to face such issues after paying such a high price.
"

  It is an absolute beast. The aquamarine green looks amazing in the real world. In the box, you'll receive the handset, the famous red cable, and a 65 watt power adapter along with Sim ejector tool, back cover, oneplus stickers and guides.While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.This is an early review and I think it's safe to say that this phone is not going to disappoint.This is the end. Good day everyone. Bye.

  This phone is very powerful which is clearly evident from its spec-list.Let me give some pros and cons after around a week of of usePros:* Great display (120 Hz is buttery smooth)*Flagship processor (SD 865). No lag whatsoever* Oxygen OS* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected*I didn't observe any significant heating while playing games*Solid build - Aluminum frame with glass back.*5G (although it will only useful in the future)*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1* 48 MP Main camera and wide angle camera is very good*Included case is goodCons:*I didn't like the 2MP micro camera and the chromatic camera (should have given a telephoto)

  Despite of being same camera as one plus 8 the picture quality is very poor of front camera. Battery back up is not good. Last only 7-8 hours. Now the touch is not working.

"
  No doubt, it's an upgrade over oneplus 8. So many features are added like 65W charger,120Hz refresh rate etc. But believe me, the quality of camera is worst. Oneplus 7 has better camera than this phone. I have been using oneplus 7 since 2 year.  Recieved this product with bubble on screen. If we remove the screen guard, then it costs around 1k for new one. Amazon supports just refused to replace this product and adviced me to visit nearest oneplus store.

  Have been using OnePlus phones for past 5+ years in the family. My last one is OnePlus 5T  which I exchanged and bought new phone OnePlus8T. Here is my review after using for more than a weekPros:Excellent and smooth 120Hz displayGaming experience is niceCons:1) Battery backup is horrible possible reasons could be phone signal keeps on varying whereas my earlier phone OnePlus5T has stable signal strength. Even otherwise battery backup is horribly wrong2) Adjusting screen brightness takes 1-2s delay to take affect3) Camera quality is not upto the mark in indoors4) while trying to make the phone 5G ready, I feel they have messed up 4G connectivity/signal things big-time.5) Alarms sometimes doesn't work properly.Review2:Battery is horribly gone wrong. Do not risk wasting your money on this product. Totally waste of your money

  Charging speed is good, battery backup and camera is average, issue in dynamic range, no night mode in front camera,needs to improve in camera, software issue also there, gallery recalculats every time all photos of the albums, and takes some time to create photos after taking shotsBlue tint when taking photos at low battery, gallery loading (recalculating), heating up, camera is average, does not get a feeling of using a premium phone paying on higher side

  Phone is good in all the features, Liked it a lot till now except the Battery Backup is not at all good if you are a continuous user of Mobile for complete whole day, you need to charge it twice/thrice a day..Rest everything is fine, Charging speed is really nice.. But never expected this low level of Battery Backup.. Disappointed ðŸ˜•Some other problems as well encountered after using it for 4 days..Not at all expected from one plusðŸ™

  Technically my fourth one plus phone (I even had the first one plus 1 not in pic). But this time it's been a let down :( .With the high refresh rates I think the phone is not able to handle the low resolution videos. There is a lot of noise in the videos. Tested on insta, YouTube, Facebook. Even tried removing the screen guard with no improvement. Not sure if this can be corrected by software.The screen is big even though narrow and one needs to use both hands playing around.Pros:Charging is fast and camera is good. And high resolution videos good.

  Awesome phone. Pros everyone are aware of. I will talk about the Cons.1. Phone heating up quite a lot. Almost every task you perform will heat up the phone.2. Camera is not up to that level. Went for OnePlus 8t instead of MI 10t for overall package but camera seems a big let down as compared to its competitor.Other than these 2 major Cons the phone is excellent in performance and call quality.Gaming in it is amazing and exciting.

"
  Very poor battery back up, my earlier one plus 6 and 7 devices were lasts for whole day and night, I usually charge my phone in the morning, but this device in full charge with moderate use lasts only for 12 hours, I have charged the phone and it confirms now that it takes more than one hour to charge the device from 6% to 100%, screen quality and sound quality is average, it is highly by overpriced.

  I've been owning the OnePlus 5T for almost three years. I still remember getting it from first ever sale on the November of 2017. It was one of the best looking and feeling phone of its time. Even after three years of usage, the phone still feels new and fast. It was adequate for my daily usage and the processing power was more than what I needed. I never had the temptation to update my OnePlus 5T until the day I broke the glass on my 5TðŸ˜­ðŸ’”. The phone fell straight on its face breaking the front glass of the display and the corner is chipped and has glass fragments in it. Though the touch and display has no problems, I often see shards of glass falling off from the phone which isn't safe for something which is in your pocket for most of the time. I decided it's time to change.I was initially looking to get an OnePlus 8 as I am a big fan of that curved display. The 8 was indeed a very good pick for my budget as it had everything that I needed and more. As I was reading through endless reviews of the 8, I came across a news about the rumours on the 8T. Since I had a spare phone on me, I decided to wait until the release of the 8T. On October 14, I saw the official unveil of the 8T and I initially thought the 8T wasn't a big upgrade to the 8. So I thought may be I should settle on the 8, but then I remembered what happened with my 5T. I also read that curved displays are more susceptible to damage even from small accidental drops. So I made up my mind and decided to go with the 8T.I ordered the phone through Amazon and it was delivered the very next day. The package was bigger than I expected. I didn't have much expectations during the unboxing. The aquamarine green color that I went with has a slight bluish tint to it. It isn't super reflective nor too matte. It has a very subtle gloss to it which doesn't attract too much fingerprints. Holding the phone on hand, I realised that it's a bit thicker and heavier than what I am used to (5T is the thinnest flagship made by OnePlus IMOðŸ‘€). But in-hand, it feels solid.Holding the power button, the phone came to life greeting me with the Hello screen and I started setting it up. As soon as I touched the screen, I felt that smooth 120 Hz display in action which makes the phone feel blazingly fast. This is a huge upgrade to me personally coming from 60 Hz. The Colors on the display pops and it is one of the best AMOLED panels out there. Personally, I had an issue with the 5T where the screen has a slightly warmer tint. It was showing while editing on Snapseed and Lightroom. But the 8T doesn't have any such issues. The display is spot on! I had an update waiting for me as soon as I finished the setup. It was for the camera, network and battery optimization. I updated the phone before starting to use it as anyone would like a bug free experience in a new device.The Oxygen OS 11 on top of Android 11 makes the user experience very pleasing and it is good for one handed usage for most of daily tasks. Scrolling on the 120 Hz is phenomenal and no words could describe it until you experience it in person. You would never have the heart to go back to 60 Hz. Oxygen OS 11 also offers a plethora of features such as Zen mode, Game Space, Insight Ambient display etc. They are very intuitive and enhances the user experience.Charging on the 65W Warp charger is a blissful experience even if you are coming from older OnePlus devices (Dash or Warp 30). It reaches 100% in 40 mins which is the time you'll spend on your morning routines. So you're good to go for the entire day if you just charge it in the morning. Battery life is also very good as I'm getting approximately 5 and a half hours of screen on time until the charge drops to 15%.Another major area of improvement is on the videography capabilities. Inclusion of portrait video mode, super stable mode, night mode video has made the video side of things very interesting. The edge detection on the portrait video works very well on slow moving and stationary subjects. 4k @ 60 and 1080p @ 240 has made videos so much usable as you could slow the videos on post and it could be stable than most. OIS also works very well. But, I feel the photography side of things could use a little tweaking on the image processing and overall white balance and contrast. The wide angle camera and the main sensor takes exceptional pictures in good lighting, but they struggle from over tinted greeny images on low light. It feels as if they are wearing night vision goggles. I hope this would be fixed on their next update. Inclusion of a macro lens is good, but for macro photography, I feel that you would need atleast a 12MP as the pictures look digitally over-sharpened on the 5MP unit.Over-all, it's a worthy buy for the money.

  Very bad phone please don't buy it has heating issue and camera is wastePlease don't waste 43 k on such a phoneFirst tym I purchased one plus phone and very much disappointed

  All lie! Camera pathetic! Low quality photos.Only main camera gives a low quality decent picture. Other modes are pathetic. Dont even try.Battery is ok, fast charging ok.Its not even a rs15,000  phone one plus using same old hardware it used 5 years ago.Pathetic features, applications just can't adjust what to do.Front camera pathetic.Screen is worst. Its cheap quality.Ram and storage is ok.Overrated phone .

  Display Okay: Nothing premiumCamera: Basic, Oneplus 6T does a better job than thisProcessing: Fast, experienced no lag what so ever in general operation. Did not play heavy games.Battery: Charges super fast, drains faster.Battery Backup: It is a sham! If you have older variants of oneplus, do not upgrade it for this one. Battery backup is horrible and you will have to charge 4-5 times a day even for medium usage. You will not get more than 4 hours even if you browse social media apps.Heating issues: Heating issues are very prominent on this device, never faced that with my oneplus 6T. The software update has also not helped with both: bad battery and heating issues.Highlight of the phone: You will get low intensity electric shock when you hold the phone near the volume buttons, also near the switch ON/OFF buttons and near the speaker at the bottom near the charging spot. I have to maneuver my hands skillfully to not feel those low intensity shock vibrations! Didn't know I needed to be low key institutionalized!

  Seriously Fast....Pros -Oxygen OS is just awesome. Smooth like butter. Very clean. Super fast experience.Nice gaming experience.Fast charging is great.Brighter & Vivid Display.Rich Sound.Android 11 ðŸ˜Š3.1 type storage.Great multimedia experience.Cons -Lpddr4x ram is not justified.Sony imx 586!! Aru you joking oneplus? In this range imx 586 is not justified.Dynamic range, color reproduction, white balance is not up to the mark. Same for selfie camera. But macro camera works well. Battery drains fast with 120Hz refresh rate, but with 60Hz display battery last long.No option for 90Hz display.

  Buy only if you have older model of phones. Warp charging is really blazing fast. Sound quality is excellent. Nothing looks practically new with 120hz refresh rate or Oxygen OS11 based on Android 11. I was already using OnePlus 7 and hence don't feel any major update in OnePlus 8T.On the contrary, I am unable to publish anything on OnePlus community as the phone gets hanged while publishing post. Also I can't update OnePlus Gallery app in play Store as all the time it  says there is some problem in update.Features like variety of navigation gestures, sms category byfurcation are much more better in OnePlus 7 than this phone. Hopefully OnePlus restores these features in OTA updates soon..Editing my review after OTA update: Finally able to install OnePlus Gallery app, MAadhar app and banking apps. Thank God it's fixed. Still, camera quality is not upto the mark. If you are a sound lover and crazy about sound quality, you can go for it.Would like to repeat myself: Go for it only if you really have very older version of phones.

  Â A great handset from OnePlus again!Pros:Warp Charging - 0-100 in 35-40minFlat DisplayPerformance with SD 865Very good sound qualityVideo stabilization is awesome!Cons:Playstore is having some issues while downloading some specific apps. Those apps are not getting installed. Many users have reported it. They will fix it next update mostly.Battery backup is average. 5-6 hours SOT in 120Hz refresh rate.Camera is just above average. Night mode is good.

  Been using for a couple of days now. I upgraded from a redmi note 5 pro. I see night and day and in performance of the 2 phones.The camera , in the few pictures I took looked really good. The display is an absolute beast. It just looks gorgeous. The 120Hz just makes it even better. Battery seems decent till now. I feel it is absolutely worth my money.

  I've been waiting for this phone's release from one month because I didn't want to buy One Plus 8 because of the curved display and..I was not disappointed...-*Display* is awesome...better than one plus 8 because I've heard that they've improved the brightness levels-*120Hz Refresh rate*....although 90hz is more than enough but in gaming and some other areas 120hz will be usefull...-*4500mah battery* is enough for our daily usage but ...you know 120hz will drain the battery faster when compared with 60hz and 90hz ..but you'll get 5-6 hours screen time easily in 120hz too-*65W charging*...woah full charging in less than 45 min ... I've kept charging at 1:10am at 18% and started surfing Instagram by the time 1:50am it was 99%..lol..-*Cameras*... I've shared some samples.. pls don't judge by those photo's because I've captured those pics 5mim before writing this review only..but they came pretty good..those were just clicked casually..but if you use them properly you'll get better pics..and they've improved the camera software and Ive heard it is better than one plus 8... they've improved ultra wide and macro camera also-*Oxygen OS*..you know Oxygen OS is awesome..I've upgraded from MiUI and I can find so much difference..no ads at all and clean software..no blotware...they have even removed Facebook lol..only Google apps and Amazon were pre installed...You can even buy oneplus phones for Oxygen OS only..it is that good-*Gaming*.. Snapdragon 865 will handle almost every game pretty well.. battery drain is also less while I'm playing Pubg and other games-Phone is very good looking and very comfortable to carry  Finally I'm happy with my purchase and specs wise it is better than OnePlus 8..But it is your wish because some feel curved display are more premium so if you like curved display you can take one plus 8..but if you're ok with any type of screen then you should definitely pick 8T over 8 ....because 8T has better specs in almost every aspect

  I have brought 8t lunar silver color and below is the my first impression.Pros -1) It feels very premium and light in weight2) UI is super fast and smooth3) Decent camearCons -1) It is observed phone heats up to some extent near camera module in normal uses as well2) It takes some time to load images in gallery or load icons once phone boots up. Seems to be storage or software issue.3) Battery gets drain very fast even though with normal uses. Yesterday I hardly able to get backup of 10 hrsBattery is the main concern to worry however I will be checking this for one more day and then decide to keep it or return

  One plus just loosing it's image. This is my first one plus phone and I got disappointed from this. Lots of software issues I am facing from this phone.Camera quality is just like a 20k phone. Battery is very much poor , do not last for atleast a single day. It must be around 5500 mah with this drainage of battery. I am unable to update one plus gallery, everytime is shows software error.Can't use stock android experience. Where the hell is oxygen OS, its very poor. My older vivo nex was far better in terms of software and UI.Call recording function not available, I can't understand simply 10k phones now a days have it.IMX 586 is outdated still they are using it in T version. One plus Nord and this device got almost same primary camera. My 2nd SIM is running on 4G or not, it is not showing. The same DDR4 , atleast this can be improved. What is meaning of T version.Camera 6/10.Battery 5/10Display 8/10Performance 9/10Software and UI 4/10Charging 10/10

  Very poor quality..so much heating problem. I have complaint about this but still amazon not resolved the issue. I have also contacted to one plus customer care but same response. I feel amazon is only for selling product not for service. Now unable to contact amazon team.

  Clean look...UI is great..battery is mediocare... getting around 5.30 hrs of talktym with 120hz ,wifi and both sim on 4g...gaming is smooth at highest graphics.. doesn't feel any heating issue while charging...camera is good for day light photos..but in indoors it just put more light and doesn't focus on image quality..so overall decent package...can give 3..(less for only camera,mediocare battery)One new problem I found with the screen .is that if you apply a pressure little bit to screen . screen tends to show a grey circle near volume button..never faced this issue in samsung

  Satisfied with the Phone Build Quality, Charging Speed, Display, Battery Backup and you name it. Camera quality is good and I have seen some videos comparing it with Samsung S20FE and iPhone 11. Those mobile costs 6k more than OnePlus 8T and camera quality difference is negligible. Of course FT and 11 does better job in some condition but in some OnePlus 8T is best. Instead of Macro and Monochrome in 8T they could have went with Telephoto lens but hey you cant have all right configuration in a smartphone and if it does people wont buy OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8Pro. The main camera sensor used in OnePlus8T is same as OnePlus 7 till OnePlus 8Pro. so that's 2 year old hardware but its best at what it is.  Anyway there is always GCam mod and you can use that to take pics. Worth the Price. Go for it.

  Bought Aqua Marine model, This is my first experience with One Plus device, and I have really been disappointed so far, the phone heats up on regular calls, while playing music and other stuffs, the battery drain is very bad. I am getting maximum screen on time of 4hrs.With 4500mAh battery I expected a lot more. This is acting like a 10-15k phone, even those phone do not heat so easily nowadays. Main Camera is Good same as Nord.The display at 120hz is the only plus point, speaker is also good, two cameras are just for show you can cover the two lenses and still take the Macro Photos with the main sensor.I will probably return the phone I am very disappointed. While writing this review the phone has started heating up.Also to mention it's very hectic task to get the phone returned. Bad bad experience with both Amazon and OnePlus 8TI have also shared the battery drain screenshots. Hope it helps to other shoppers.

  Extra ordinary on one side, terrible on the other.Pros:1. Good display with 120 Hz sceeen. Simply stunning.2. Super fast processor and OS. Though Android 11 has some glitches, I'm sure OP will fix them soon.3. Aesthetically designed well, weight distribution is uniform & handling the phone is way easier thanks to the flat screen.4. Load speaker is good though the bottom speaker is loader making the steteo experience little awkward at times. But never mind, they're good.5. The haptic feedback of the vibration motar is good and feels premium6. Build quality is top notch. The camera bump looks way better in reality than in the picturesCons1. Oh god, what a horrible camera. It's pathetic. I previously used OP6 and felt even that 3 year old phone does a similar job at clicking below par pictures.2. Why make a glass phone if you don't want to include wireless charging. Specially in 2020, at 46k? Its like spending money on an expensive suit and not buy shoes but wear flip flops! HuhConclusion: it's a decent phone but I feel OP got it all wrong with the pricing and features of their 3 phones. The Nord, regular and the pro series. The OP Pro at almost 14k more expensive than the regular isn't worth it for what it offers. But again, is the One plus regular worth over the nord at almost 20k premium? 765G processor is just as good is what I've heard. If you can wait, please don't buy 8T or 8 Pro. Wait for 9.Dear OP, instead of cutting down on ""not so expensive stuff"" on your regular versions, please try to create something new for your Pro versions that would make them worthy of buying.q

  A great phone at this price. The back main camera pictures are nice but they should improve the front camera specially provide night mode. Battery life is good and last throughout the day. It gets a little warm sometimes, note I don't play heavy games much and there is a hollow feeling at the back of the phone when speakers are on. But overall I'm happy with my decision and the performance of the phone is undoubtedly great.

  Reviewing it after 2 weeks of use:Pros:1. Charging speed - Outstanding (20-100% in ~30 minutes)2. Display and touch - Excellent (120Hz is frigging awesome!)3. The hardware in general is really good4. Fingerprint Scanner -  Fast as hell5. No green tint issues on display6. Phone barely heats while charging7. Phone barely heats while gaming8. Even the lowest brightness shows excellent blacks.Cons:1. Average camera - Photos in good light are excellent, but photos taken at lowlight/using nightscape sucks. However, if you use Pro mode (or Gcam), the quality is excellent. That shows that the camera lenses are fine, it's the stock camera software that's bad.2. Poor battery life on dark mode - If you use dark theme, your phone almost always gonna be at 120Hz, resulting in below average battery life. It doesn't dynamically switch the refresh rate on dark mode. However, if you use light theme for the system, the battery is good. This is a clear software issue. Samsung S20 FE with similar specs gets 9hours SOT at 120Hz. We get barely 5.5 hours on dark mode. That's bad. This is due to the dynamic refresh rate switching not working on dark mode.PS: Got 2 updates in the 2 weeks that I started using my phone, which were supposed to fix power optimization and camera quality. No noticeable difference came.Verdict: Good phone with a great hardware and poor software.If you are good at rooting and custom roms flashing, wait for custom roms to come and use those. In the meantime, you can root and flash custom kernels. That actually improved my SOT. Even though OxygenOS is clean looking, it's just the look. The performance is bad.

  I have been using Redmi Note 4 from past 3 years and moving to Oneplus 8T is such an amazing experience. Everything is best in this phone. Although it's little pricy, its completely worth it for the experience it providesSome of the best features i cant ignore1) Blazing fast fingerprint and face unlock2) 120hz refresh rate gives a very smooth and fast experience3) 4k video recording4) 12GB RAM and 865 Qualcomm Snapdragon so that you never compromise on performance at any cost5) 1080 HD displayðŸ˜ƒAll over above...man, the charging....charges like a flash,ðŸ˜…

  Being used to OnePlus family of devices right from the One to Five to now 8T, it's been a journey of change, bigger screens, fast to ultra fast charging, however the camera could've been better!+120Hz is slick, you may not want to go back to 60Hz+Warp charge 65 is blazing fast, and the bottom doesn't heat up as well+Display is nice and pleasing+Droid 11 out of the box, however Oxygen OS has the biggest change by deviating from stock Android to customisations (some would like it while some wouldn't)+Buttery smooth OS, works like a charm-Some customisations are really good use-battery lasts for a day and more based on usage, but with the warp charge, you never run out of power+Cooling system is too good, you never feel too much heat even after long hours of use or gaming+Always on is a nice feature and I love the Canvas-Camera is good but nothing evolutionary, OP needs to work in this areas on hardware rather than always tweaking the algorithms-Some apps are not customized to 120Hz refresh and may act weird-OS design seems to be heavily influenced from Samsung, OP can do better on their own and do good-Elegant design nevertheless, nothing groundbreaking-Might feel a tad heavy for someLastly,Aquamarine green looks lovely in the hand, worth picking it up over the SilverOp7t users and above can wait for Op9

Oneplus 8 or 8pro has some display and heating issue but this is goodGood part1. Phone charging is very very fast. Charge in 30-40min to 100%2. Decent camera3. It comes with phone cover and temperad glass4. This phone looks like premium quality.5. Snapdragon 865 processor ðŸ˜Bad part1. I feel this phone little hot during transferring the phone date from old phone to this one. But it's not all the time. Now it's working well.2. Camera could have been little better. Oneplus need to workon it. Samsung S20 FE has better camera.If someone do not want to buy this phone then I will suggest them.Samsung S20 FE or Mi10T ProThese set are with same range and almost same configuration.I did't not go with Samsung S20FE beacuse it has shitty processor which is octa-core Samsung Exynos 990.

  Here is the review of my own device.Starting with the screen-1. Beautiful amoled panel with accurate colours.2. 120hz display is lit.3. Brightness goes really high, didn't face any problem while using on direct sunlight.4. Flat screen is more secure than curve.Performance-1. Snapdragon 865, lag free experiences.2. In Day to day use, no problem.Camera -1. Sony imx586 is here, pictures are lil saturated.2. Nightscape is great.3. Video quality is good enough and stable too.Looks n feel-1. This have glass back so its too slippery. (Use protective case, use soft case)2. The colour aquamarine green is sick. This one is glossy. My friend bought the lunar silver one, that's matte finish.Summary-Great performance, good enough camera and the 65watt charge is also fast it takes max 44-45min to charge 0-100% . *Oneplus give software update fast to upgrade ta camera quality*

  Reviewing after 24 hours of usage, don't buy this product .., it's getting overheating while playing games with internet or using other apps such as Netflix / youtube with WiFi ...

  Pros:-OnePlus tag-120hz display is Buttery smooth!-Camera, I will be honest... it's a very good camera but could have been better.. I'm sure through updates it will improve!-battery it's super fast thanks to 65w charger !-The haptic's  in this device is well balanced and it is well pronounced!-Design and in hand feel is just amazing.Cons:-Camera (it's a con for those who want the bestest camera out there...and this is simply not the best)-No IP rating-No wireless charging (which I couldn't care less)

  This is my first experience with one plus which is not good at all. Initially whhen the phone was delivered i was prtty kuch excited but as I strt to install stuff n set up my google ac n all the phone strtd to heat up. I put it on charge it heated up prtty bad. Okay so does any new phone gts heated up on the 1st day itself? I was very disappointed . I contacted Amazon customers service thy sent a tchnician at my plce , he said the phone doesn't have any issue . I didn't have any other choice left then to use it.I would rate my experience till now- Battery - 3.5/5 ( battry backup is not good at all)Camera- 4.5/5Speed- 4/5Sound -4.5/5Screen qualify -4/5The only issue is that it heats up very fast n vry bad. While playin not so heavy games it heats up. While charging it heats up prtty bad.Overall i would say i expxtd much more at this price from one plus. Its would make an awesome phne if there was no heating issues.

  Well you must already know the specifications of this device by now and this device is a beast.it took me less than 3 min to download and install around 40 appsi would suggest you go with the 12gb RAM variant120Hz display is butter smooth and you do notice the difference between a 60hz and a 120hz displayI was a little skeptical about the camera performance but if you are not a photographer  this camera is more than enough for youBattery life is pretty goodIt will easily last you for a day but keep in mind that this is not a two days deviceCharging speed is just unreal it charges to 100% in 45 min which is insaneConnectivity A+ no issues thereJust one concern- they should have given the type-c to 3.5mm dongleso just go for itits a great deal

  I am a loyal Oneplus user and i upgraded from One plus 6t to OP8T.Build: Absolutely great build quality. Build quality is always great on the one plus devices. Even though it has a massive screen, it still feels okay to hold it in one hand. Beware that since both sides are glass, it is slippery. So it is advisable to use a caseSoftware & UI: Oxygen OS has been close to stock android since so long but with the new OS which comes out of the box with OP8T, there has been a shift in that. It is now more customized, which depending on your tastes, you may or may not like. I liked it. Loved the dark theme. The best thing is the lock screen customization which shows the number of unlocks.Camera: The chink in the armor of OP8T is the camera. Its actually worse than the OP6T i was using. The sensors are quite old and i just dont get the monochrome camera which take very bad photos. Dont get me wrong. Compared to a normal midrange phone, it is still very good. It performs like a dream in natural light conditions but really struggles in the low light. The one feature i really liked was the selfie portrait video mode.Battery: Superb battery life. I am a fairly heavy user and till now i end the day with >55% battery. The charging speed is also superb. It takes hardly 25 mins to go from 15% to 95%. Although i wish there was an option of slow charging.Bottom Line: One plus 8T is a solid all round phone with mediocre cameras. If you are a photography buff, look at Samsung S20 FE. But if you want a phone which will last you for years and keep up the great performance, you can look at OP8T.

  Oneplus has lost its charm. No more flagship. Oneplus is now more like any other phone company who want to release new phones with more profit and less features. Battery back up is so horrible from day one battery draining is a big problem. Battery drains a lot even phone is idle. Over night battery will drain 10%. I am not sure i have got defect piece from Amazon and also I can see review in youtube saying 9 hours of Screen on time. I am getting max 4 to 5.30Hrs. Camera clarity is pathetic. Selfie is horrible. Beautify is like Chinese app how lips will become pink like that selfie camera is. I am going to service center for issue on unnecessary battery drain. Just for 14 mins watching prime Video 7% battery drain. Better buy Iphone 12 or Samsung FE or Samsung S20

  Pros:Super fast chargingUltra speed with 120hz displayHas Android 11 and will have good updatesWonderful design and colourCons:The worst camera that you can find. I upgraded from pixel 2xl to this and it's very disappointing to see the pics from the camera.Main 48 MP cannot do white balance or add contrast. Most of the images from other cam is not natural it destroys the sharpness.All the plus gets destroyed just for the worse camera. Totally disappointed with the cam performance

Sound Is really loud and somewhat clear5. Good speed as expectedCons:1. Network issues.. call disconnctions2. Bulky in Hand3. Cameras are average. Camera quality will disappoint you in low light4.  Can't use both 4G VoLTE SIMs  simultaneously Only 15. Battery life is not so great6. Highly Priced as starting competative price should be around 30k7. Not value for money8. Auto call recording  is not thereOverall  If you are first time OnePlus user you feel amazed somewhat but upgrade users will be disappointed due high expectations.Worst calling experience.. auto call cut issue

  I rarely write reviews but this time I thought I need to share my experience, I was little disappointed to see how Indian audience get influenced by tech reviewers (especially the USA one). They are comparing a device which is launched $100 more to an Indian pricing so there experience will be totally different considering the price point.In India it is for almost $540 dollars. In this price range I don't think we will get any better value. Very good phone with an above average camera, if you're clicking for social media then in 95% of the cases all the high-end camera looks same. Software experience is surreal; Almost similar like pixel.Pixel 5  and 4A 5G is not available in India plus Google mobile strategy sucks in IndiaSamsung FE is 130 dollars more than 8T. I was using S9 and believe me after 7-8 months Samsung phones start lagging. They force you to use their crappySamsung play store. Samsung software is really pain some time.iPhone 12 - Damm expensive in an Indian market, Price difference from an International pricing is insane.Apparently Yes, They are doing to much marketing with their camera system. 2 lenses are crap but overall its a very capable Cam plus if we get the GCAM for 8T. BOOM.Under 550$ this is the best value a consumer can get in an Indian market.I am using this device for the last 6 days - No heating issues (I didn't use for gaming purpose), No blue or red tint on screen, Sound quality is good but it's just you feel little vibration at back when u play songs at max volume - I reckon its common in stereo speakers because i felt the same in other devices also.P.S: Not a 1+ fan, never used their devices as my regular daily drivers (previously I was using Galaxy S8/S9 and believe me it feels 3X faster to those phones) but this is the company which is really hearing their customer (especially in India) Cheers!

  Overall the phone is damn good, but I see some following issues in the phone like,1. IVR will not work all the time.2. Notifications are not syncing, though I read the message, still the notification will not clear.3. Sometimes if I click on the notification, it will not redirect to the app. I need to open it manually and clear the notification manually again.4. Keypad will jam quite often while switching from text to emoji and vice versa.I would request OnePlus team to focus on these bugs and fix it ASAP.

  I have purchase OnePlus 8t on 16th ..I am facing problem in my device .. it's too buggy .. please help me to resolve my problem....

  Pros; Performance & Battery life is very impressive.Cons; Very Low standard Camera in this price point specially the Selfie camera,in low light conditions its like low range oppo vivo selifie. As u can see in my uploaded images, Unnatural  tones and added colours,where as the rear camera is a bit acceptable.as a whole in this price point ans segment Cameras Could have been improved.Even older 6T camera selfie is far better than 8T
"
"
  The display of the 8T is really good with the 120hz refresh rate. The phone heats up quite frequently. The camera performance is very mediocre. It can be hardly considered to belong in the cost segment it's priced at. The photographs are excessively smoothened out and lacks detail. The saturation and colour is also compromised. This is a big letdown. The macro and the super macro modes are also pretty bad. The cellular network range is not good too.
"
"
  I am very disappointed with one plus team just camera quality of one plus 8T is not good if you are paying 43k. Beacsue I am using one plus 5 last 3 years there is no huge difference quality propesct in 8T If you enlarge picture all picture are become blur.Please go for other options if you are looking for better camera.

  Honestly I would have never ever imagined to switch brands..!!Ive been an die hard fan of Samsung and have only been using the Note Series since 10 yearsI had confusion between the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or One Plus 8TAnd i am glad i made the right choiceâ™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸First impressions the colour i am Awee StruckAquamarine Green like the most amazing colour everðŸ˜ðŸ˜The Design is so simple yet so cleanly crafted.

  Writing this review after a week of rigorous use. The device is light and evenly balanced. The product touch response @240Hz is buttery smooth! Be assursed that you will find all other smartphones less responsive than this. So you just don't have the option to revert. The processor SD865 is one of the fastest in the market and all the setup installations will hardly be felt. Furthermore, unlike other processors, this processor doesn't heat the phone much and also the heat vapour chamber inside the phone ensures the temperature remains at the optimum level. The calling and network quality which majority reviewers don't mention about are also glitch free. The very first OTA update was downloaded within few seconds, such is the WiFi 6 network connectivity coupled with ultrafast UFS 3.1 data storage technology. The display refresh rate @120Hz simply makes the viewing content lag free and flawless. The display brightness of upto 1100 nits will permit you to operate your phone even in the mid of summer daylight, such is its fantastic brightness. Ambient light is also decent but not perfectly synchronized with the light sensor. Hence generally less brighter than the surrounding light. Earpic loudness is pretty good. Even a nearby person can hear the call. Stereo sound loudness is great too but with some compromise in quality as the sound appears to be coming from light plastic frame speakers and not those from box speakers. The phone at the peak volume also starts to vibrate a lot, giving somewhat an inferior feel. Phone OS is minimalistic yet pretty fulfilling. Enthusiasts may have additional features by installing 3rd party apps. The UI customisation is also pretty good! This will make sure that you do not get bored with the same personalised display content. The 65W warp charging is simply superb while setting a benchmark which all other smartphone brands have to match with, else the customer's changed habit will not allow them to revert to their previous brand at any cost. Hopefully this ultra fast charging doesn't degrade the 4500mAh battery at a faster pace which already gives around one day of normal usage. The side buttons are also pretty decent and require only an optimum gentle push for their functioning. But the camera setup used in this phone is not so impressive as the other setups used. Oneplus' touting of dual LED beside the cameras is actually misleading in the sense as the optical glasses of the LED and the colour temperature sensor looks almost similar. So effectively there is only one hole section allotement for LED and not two. But on closer look one may actually find that in this section there are two small LEDs, which unfortunately is not so bright to even match with the normal single LED of many smartphones. So selling the phone by showcasing the feature of dual LED setup simply shows the company's product selling-oriented intent. The macro and monochrome sensors used are also more of a gimmick to make the phone have quad camera setup. Majority of the time macro camera just doesn't focus properly. So it becomes easy to shoot with the primary camera. But the primary camera too has focusing issues at the nearby object but not so much as that of macro camera. This focusing problem can be ignored if one uses the manual focusing in pro mode at the expense of some time. The colours are also lost or hued greater due to some non perfect processing and hence true images are not produced especially in the macro camera. Switching from 12MP to 48MP also doesn't make even a slight difference in the image quality except increasing the file size dramatically. Usage of two years old Sony IMX586 sensor in primary camera just turns off many enthusiasts who keep on purchasing newer and more expensive phones to just improve the camera quality by a mere fraction percent. Brands like Apple using a decade old hardware technology in some of their's hardware configuration are yet able to outsell major brands due to their pretty decent camera. The Oneplus 8T's obsolete camera setup and it's associated focusing issue was felt so disappointingly on the first hands on experience after using years of brilliant Samsung's camera that I even decided to return the phone altogether and again go back to Samsung's newly released S20 FE by ignoring its ever heating Exynos processor. But after tweaking with pro mode and observing that the manual focus can produce acceptable pictures, I thought that may be with OTA update the focusing issue and colour dynamic range will be improved and thereafter Oneplus 8T could be called as a true ""Flagship Killer"" of 2020. Till then this ""Ultra stops at something!""

  I got this new phone Oneplus 8T just a week back with exchange in sale with discount and let me tell u it's worth every penny if u r looking for a premium phone in this price range...I have 12gb variant aquamarine..in hand it feels so good that apple 12 might shy a bit here...i did a comparison of it with apple 12 and trust me except camera and speed(which normaly everyone doesnt even care about) this can give a tough competition to apple 12. Battery runs more than 24 hrs a day and charges in just 40 mins with warp charging wired set. Oxygen OS is good afterall it is termed as world best android os...prior to this i had k20 pro...same chipset same features but whats different here is a bit improved screen and premium feel...refresh rate of 120 hz feels amazing..so smooth...beats apple here...amoled dispaly is awesome...Back sony imx camera is good not as good as Oneplus 8 pro but it is not at all bad. The only thing which i would have wanted to improve is battery...though it goes for 1 day without any issues but it heats up a bit with wifi and heavy gaming and also starts losing charge fast. Thats the only issue i see in this one but i saw couple of videos comparing oneplus 8t to other one plus devices and it seems it has the highest runtime compared to others...but heating is an issue for sure

  Pros:-1. Beautiful, flat, smooth display;2. Clean and light software, Netflix being the only third part bloatware that can't be installed;3. Flagship chipset + 3.1 storage + light software guarantees seamless performance;4. Insanely fast charging;5.  Comes with Android 11 out of the box, which is a pro considering the pathetic state of the android update situation;6. Comes with a screen protector pre applied and a transparent TPU case included in the box;7. Build is premium and seems to be sturdy.Cons:-1. Really bad cameras considering the price. A useless macro camera and a ""monochrome"" camera that does literally nothing. Then there's a flash-looking sensor that also plays no apparent role ever. The photos are worse than what I get from my 5-year-old S7 edge;2. Battery life is average. Sometimes discharges really quickly;3. The battery saver mode doesn't seem to save much battery;4.No headphone jack.Overall a very good product but the poor camera performance ruins the experience to a big extent for me.I shall update this review as I continue to use this phone.

  Performance is good, but a 10000rs phone can capture betrer photos than this phone. I regret that i have purchased this one.now the battery draining.. I should not have purchased this one.After 2weeks of use:-1) camera is not upto the mark, but not bad.2) battery life has improved drastically. It can give you more than 6and a half hour of sot with 120hz refresh rate.3) go for this instead of mi10t pro or samsung s20fe. S20fe comes with a higher price tag and performance is nowhere in comparison to 8t, but the camera is slightly better in fe.

  I have moved from iOS to Android and trust me to have this beast during the transition phase is an absolute pleasure. Display is amazing, 120 hgz refresh rate really does the job in terms of your viewing experience going to the next level. I don't play games but usually keep on checking emails,chats etc as part of work and this is much better than an iPhone where in entire day was spent on charging the phone. Camera is superb as well. To sum up its indeed is a great buy.
"

  To be honest OnePlus 8T is a awesome mobile with latest Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system. However, couple of cons which i have noticed is; 1) Battery: Need to charge twice a day- all credit to Warp Charge 65 power adapter which is really a boon while you need to charge twice a day.2) I am not sure if anyone has noticed, Mobile Bank applications like Canara bank and Yono (SBI) applications won't open. (Checked with other OnePlus 8T mate and same is the case)3) Camera is other drawback which i hardly use, so people who are not camera freak can ignore.Apart from the above everything is super cool, people can go for it & stay relaxed on the latest updates until next 5 years with 5G mobile.Thanks to Amazon for in time delivery.

  This review is from a normal user, a working personal. Best useful feature for me is fast charging. Amoled display is noticeably better than IPS LCD. Camera is surely better than most phones under 30k. Phone is very fast. And phone speakers are very loud and clear. Audio quality is also superb. Most importantly if you're just a normal user who mainly use phone for calls, checking social media, occasionally clicking snaps then I don't suggest to buy expensive phone. 20k phones are enough for that kind of usage. High spec phones are for hard-core users and gamers.

  Excellent ðŸ‘Œ...I have been using oneplus brand since it's x model was launched 2015. Used it for 2.5 yrs without any issue. Here I became a fond of OnePlus..Than after I bought oneplus 5t in 2017. 5T : I would say about the 5T was damn good man...still in efficient performance i.e. stable battery with real 6gb ram speed though was being even rough used for the last 4yrs. Than I wish to change the phone just because of the shake of expanses on gadgets since I haven't spend money with phone since last 4yrs ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ. I ordered 8pro with 12gb ram. Unfortunately I returned that piece since I got update about upcoming launch of 8T.8T... It's an amazing phone.. I accept that battery little weak with 120ghz display but still you have option to use phone most of the time on 60ghz. 120 to be used once if it is required i.e. watch movie. Games etc.

  The OnePlus 8T cuts the right corners, keeps the right premium features and packages it all in a gorgeously looking piece of glass that feels more ready-to-be-used than any other phone. Itâ€™s the most reliable, most user-friendly OnePlus so far. Itâ€™s absolutely worth its price and it is a 10/10 device..ðŸ‘‰ Stellar performance. 120Hz + 865 + 12GB RAM + 3.1 makes the 8T an absolute beast.OxygenOS 11 delivers stellar performance and feels more natural than ever. Being the only android phone with Android 11 out-of-the-box is an icing on the cake.ðŸ‘‰ Great camera. It performs just as good as 8 Pro (considering 8T is much cheaper), even the 5MP lens is surprisingly capable, I use the B/W cam a lot actually. Throw almost anything at the camera and it will be handled with care. Images come out very well-balanced, the camera is reliable in every case and if you know how to work the exposure settings, you will not miss a thing.ðŸ‘‰ WARP Charge 65 is the best innovation since high refresh rates. Having the freedom to have your phone fully charged in half an hour is truly luxurious and makes your life much better. Battery life is quite great & the best in any OnePlus device till now.ðŸ‘‰ Price. It's a flagship level OnePlus phone that is fully worth its money at 46/43kðŸ‘‰The phone is packed with several other features like the Always on Display & the standard OnePlus Alert slider which will make your day to day usage much better..As a personal advice I will suggest you to go for the 12/256 version as you may regret not spending that extra 3k later..And don't believe whatever these so called reviewers are saying about OnePlus 8T as I found out from my personal experience that all of them were highly biased and wrong in most aspects. You can buy this phone blindly and you will never regret it.

  This OnePlus 8T have some software issue from bigning . In oneplus community app you can see so many people are posting the same issue everyone facing app crash issue, app not getting updated ,parellen app can't get access to your gallery, big gaming app more then 1 to 2 gb are not installing,banking app get crash so many issue have on OnePlus 8T.Before I am using OnePlus 3 it's still working better then OnePlus 8T.So before buying think twice don't waste your money

  This is my first one plus device and I mus say I am impressed. I have received this device on 18th oct and have been using this for past 7 days. Here are my two cents-Pros-1. Buttery smooth performance. 120hz is a treat2.Fluid amoled display- great colors and contrast3. Camera is pretty good in day light conditions and there are ample settings available including pro mode (f1.7 aperture)4.Charging speed is phoenamenal. Love the warp charge 65Cons:1. While setting up the device, phone did get quite heated and os gave warning. It basically happened during app transfer from my old device. Although after that even during charging I never saw temperature going above 40. With normal to heavy usage it remains under 40 degrees which is good.2. Low light camera performance is noisy.although with nightscape one can take decent photos.3. Few apps such as Kotak Mahindra are not working on android 11/oxygen 11With that being said I didn't notice anything else- no black crush,green tint or purple tint/banding. All good. In this price segment, it is well justified phone.

  Bought last week but frequent call disconnections with 9 out of 10 calls getting disconnecting while on calls. This is causing embarrassment while on conference calls at work. Also doesn't allow to make outgoing calls randomly and has to be restarted.  Need to go for replacement with another model if issues persists with next 3 to 4 days.

  I upgrade this phone from my oneplus 7. I am a huge fan of oneplus phones since oneplus 3. As always this is the best product till date.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but it is not as great as its competitor flagship phones.Pls hit helpful button if you find it helpful.

  One plus 8T is a premium flagship phone by one plus. Truly speaking it's  a good phone . SD865 is beast performance processor and I haven't face any lag . camera Quality is awoseme as its Sony IMX. ufs.31 storage is  superfast . 65 W Superwarp charge  ,charges the phone from 0 to 50 in 14 min. Only 1 thing which I faced as a issue , when playing pubg or other high graphics game , after 20 min , u will feel heating issues .

  Was waiting to upgrade from 3T and since was happy finally upgraded to 8T.Pretty decent and working as expected for 3 days of usage , Wrap charge is big change seriously Full charge in less than 1 hr and good  battery backup. Pretty decent photos and macro mode.Sound is good as you have stereo speakers.The display and refresh speed you can see a considerable improvement.At last you can blindly get this phone.

"
  Â 1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS 11, which runs as smooth as they come.2) SUPER AMOLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above best.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is best.7) Phone Charging is mind blowing. Need just 40 min to Full charge.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is Very very fast.10) The camera is good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera is awesome. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording1080@60fps performance is good. (The camera is better than most phones out there)11) No headphone jack.12) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio is well delivered on a stereo speaker.413) No expandable memory slot.14) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen is as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.

  Writing this review after using the phone for one week. Thanks to one plus for bringing a high end phone with a flat display. This is one of the best devices you can get around 40k budget considering its specs. Major Pros and Cons listed belowPros:1. Fast Charging - 40 mins from 0-100 and more than 50% in 20 mins.2. 120Hz refresh rate - Feels super smooth and the FHD+ AMOLED panel is excellent.3. Compact and light design - Weighs only 188gms and is easy for one handed use due to thin long 20:9 aspect ratio screen.4. Dual speakers, singnal reception, network speeds etc... are all flagship level.Cons:1. Heating while playing games - Did notice heating while playing asphalt 9 and pes 2021. Temperature reaches about 42Â°C in 20 mins gaming.2. Camera setup is not good - Disappointed with the main camera and ultrawide photos. Both these cameras struggles at different loghting conditions and the colors are way off. Video capturing and stability with the vidoes are okay. 5MP macro camera and the selfie camera are somewhat good.3. Battery life while using 120hz is just okay for heavy users. It will not last a full day but a 15 mins top up with the speed charger will help.4. Not so impressive in benchmarks - may be due to LPDDR4X ram, benchmark scores are not the highest when compared to the other flagships that uses new DDR5 rams.

  Its been 10 days now i am using this product OnePlus 8T giving you all a genuine feedback. Let me tell you it is superrrr fast. Touch is super smooth. Love it. But besides these fancy thingsLets Talk about battery life first: Battery life is not that great but average. Since there is a fast charger you will be able to charge it full in 40-45 Mins.Actually the worth of this product should be around 32-35k. It is costly. Camera is not that good as you would expect in a flagship phone since you are paying around 45,999 Rs excludig the variable discounts. The discounts are less in these oneplus products.One day I used Asphalt 9, the device got super heated that i thought may be its gonna blast in my hand so I just kept it outside my balcony.During charging also the device gets heated.Its a risk I personally think. I have paid a huge amount for this product. I didn't expected this.About the camera and other stuffs i will update later...

  I am posting my review after using 30 daysComing to PRO's:1.Screen Quality is Good ( No tints) (120hz is butter smooth) ( very very thin borders )2.Fast charging is amazing , full charge in less than 40 mins ( pls nibba's to enjoy fast charging disable optimised charging in settings)3.Battery life is good , simply lasts a day ( SOT purely depends on user usage)4.Sound Quality is good enough and as well loud enough, you will love them.5.Build quality is good , ( slim, weight distribution is top notch)6.Android 11 out of the box means you can get an extra android verson update compared to oneplus 8 and 8 pro ***Cons:1.Camera on paper does not beat competition and 2 years old ( working 2 years on same camera made OnePlus awesome futures like ""video in nightsite"" ""portrait video "" both features doing well) (3&4 th camera modules- seriously OnePlus  you are better than this )2.Gorilla glass 5 on front and Back ( you can go for 6 this time)3.Lpddr4x ram ( where mi 10 and find X2 using lpddr5 ram)4. Only two color options avilable5. OnePlus dailer and message apps is replaced by ugly looking Google dailer and Google message appOpinions:1.In past 30 days I never regret for my decision choosing OnePlus 8t over OnePlus 8 ( except using ugly Google dailer and message app)2. The nibba's and nibbi's talking about several bugs those are all not  8t bugs , seriously those are android 11 beta bugs which can be cleared by system updates and OnePlus is very seriously working on 8t updates ( i got 4 system updates in 30 days ðŸ˜„ insane) when u r accessing early stuff there will be risksðŸ‘.3. For more opinions u can come to the link https://t.me/OnePlus8T5G , u can check and talk to number of OnePlus 8t owners and users

  Coming from OnePlus 6 I had a great expectations from OnePlus 8t. But after purchase I regretting it. OnePlus 6 was far much better than 8t. 8t has a pathetic camera quality. Imagine a flagship PHN having a pathetic camera. Signal reception quality is not satisfactory, my mom's realms 5 pro gives better network reception quality than this overhyped 8t. Overall not satisfied at all.

  Updated review:After Oxygen Os 11.0.5.6 update, the stock camera very equal quality to gcam. No issues with my phone. Great phone for 44250 rupees price.Old review:I m planning to buy iphone 11 but after launching 8t I decided to buy 8t because of display, charging speed, performance, higher internal storage for lower price.Pros1.amazing screen without any issues2. battery, SOT is above 8 hrs3. Performance4. Camera with great photos and great night mode-  I was using gcam and sd865 processing is great for gcam and stock camera photos also.5. Front camera also good6. Oxygen os 117. Charging- 15 to 100% in 32 minutesCons.1. Price is little bit higher. If they priced under 40k then it will be great deal.Verdict:If you want allrounder phone definitely go for it of 256gb variant because if you use this phone long term usage then definitely need high storage.

  This OP8T is beast. Overall every of your single task, multi task, camera performance, gaming and everything is best in it.. most of all I'm game lover, loved to play pubg in it..ðŸ˜ You'll never get disappointed by this beast.. I've come along from Samsung A50.. I've seen a lots of changes, the 120hz display gives you the buttery smooth while scrolling news feed or using any of the system. Just in love with this flagship killer device.Snapdragon 865 just killing it.. you won't get enough in other.. just go for it blindly..ðŸ¥° mine took only 5 days to arrive at my place and I'm happy with it.. device's mind blowing..

  Right of the bat, I would like to list the slightly bad thing about the phone which is pretty much the camera. It does the job though. It's a pretty decent camera which will practically do anything you might want to do in your day to day use. If you just want to professionally shoot pictures, just buy a camera.Now that the camera is out of the way, I think there is nothing where OnePlus is lacking. The display is absolutely gorgeous (and it's FLAT). The bezels are thin and sweet. The performance is absolutely crushing any other phone in this range (at par with the flagships). The feel of the phone in the hand and looks are just great. The 120Hz feels very smooth. And finally, the Oxygen OS is gorgeous.I would say if you are looking for a phone which has the best camera, this is not it. But if you are okay with a decent camera, this phone is an absolute beast everywhere else.

  My experience:Fingerprint reader- goodCamera quality- good (not very impressive but in terms of OnePlus cameras over a past series of phones , it's getting better ""my thought"") and also there is somany features in camera section which can consume your time with phone.Processor- impressive speed with new2.86 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-core Processor + Adreno 650 GPU ,Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system.Display- my previous phone was poco F1 so my comparison comes with a limited sight. So, very smooth........120 Hz gives us a smooth experience.Weight- light weightDesign- as always classy design from OnePlus.Battery- 4500 mah battery is not bad while watching videos even in 120 hz it gives us more time for continuous watch. But, I noticed something when I play games. I played a lot of games. I spend more time with ' pubg ' than other games. So when I started playing pubg in my fully charged OnePlus 8T , condition was good. Battery is steady and it takes time to get drain. But after continuous use, heating problem arises and battery drains fast ( after 30 - 50 minutes of usage ).Gaming- other than battery drainage gaming was awesome.Warp Charger- very fast I mean realy realy fast.Note :There is no 3.5 mm audio jack. So you should wait again for the arrival of audio jack converter unless you already have c type headset .My overall experience was nice with OnePlus 8T but battery is still a problem as a gamer hope they will fix this issue with upcoming series........

  Purchased One Plus 8T as an upgrade to my One Plus 5, which I have been using for 3 years. Had high expectations but Super disappointed with this latest offering from One Plus.1. Poor Network stability - My airtel sim faced constant disruptions while connecting to internet. (Was smooth in One Plus 5 at the same area). Used to keep my OnePlus 5 as a hotspot to no issues but 8T gave constant disruptions.2. Less than impressive Battery life - Although battery gets charged to 100% in less than 40 mins, it gets drained fast as well. Charging speed is great owing to the 65w warp charger (My one Plus 5 charged faster as well)3. Okayish Camera - Nothing special or great to be said to be camera as well. Expected a better camera at this price range.Looks like One Plus is focussing on Nord this year, putting their least efforts in a very mediocre 8T.The only pros are 120 Hz refresh rate ( which drains the battery) and the high RAM and storage options the phone provides.There is no tap & pay option and wireless charging option, which is expected at this price range.Suggest to look for other options at this price range or wait for better ones than going for 8T. There is no Return option for the phone as well.Highly disappointed, One Plus! Probably the worst phone by One Plus. My One Plus 5 fared better.

  I ordered the phone with 7 minutes after the launch @ Amazon - I have received the product by next day- Packaging and delivery was pretty fast and good as usual.Post unboxing - Phone display and performance are really awesome  12GB + 256 GB storage - 120 Hz display gives the complete ultra smooth display.Battery remains for a day and half - 27 hrs with Wifi on.Camera quality - 4.5 / 5Display - 5/5Battery - 4.3/5Finally  the Oneplus 8T is a great flagship from Oneplus - Thanks for the Nice Design!

  Great product.If you are still confused between OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8T,then take a deep breath and go for 8T.Very very smooth.Camera needs some improvement.Warp charge 65 is just outstanding.120hz refresh rate is just fantastic.Snapdragon 865 does it's job very well.Complete beast.It does not has any display issues like 8 and 8 pro.

  This mobile is not a worthy update for existing OnePlus user. People using OnePlus 7t and above, please don't upgrade to this device. The camera has bugs and still shoes some issues after OOS update. Even the battery is draining a lot without a full day usage. Phone starts heating even for some basic tasks like voice calls and camera.So this is not a value for money mobile to go with. Instead select a OnePlus 8 mobile which seems to be great package
"
"
  For review and working of the phone, please go to Youtube, you will get much better reviews of the product. I upgraded from Samsung to Oneplus and every penny is worth. If you are a Oneplus 8 user, no need to upgrade but if not and you are looking for a flagship with a 50K budget then you must go for this phone without giving a second thought. Though I did my own research, you can also decide after viewing unboxing and reviews on Youtube. :-)

  I bought it on the 1st day of the Great Indian Festival. Posting this review after using it for 1 week.1. Amazing Display: The 120Hz display makes it super smooth.(I was previously using Red Magic 3 which had a 90 Hz display. I can say the difference is visible)2. Good Battery Life: Its 2020, lets agree all phones it this range are coming with big battery. The battery(4500 mah) is decent enough to take you through your day considering the amazing 120 hz refresh is always on. Again the amazing fast charging always keeps you going within 10 mins of charging.3. Camera: I won't say its the best camera out there but its really good. As OnePlus has been using the same camera for the past some versions of Oneplus flagships, shows up that refinement in picture quality.4. Performance: There is no complaints here, the SD 865 paired with 8 GB & that refresh ratio, you can expect everything to be fluid be it watching videos, playing high end games, scrolling etc5. Build Quality is also pretty good.6. Good to have all latest - wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, Ufs 3.1

  I read lot of reviews and all but it's my opinionWhat I like:- It's the fastest charging I've seen (0-100 less than 40 min)- Signal reception(Data speeds), I don't about how Apple, Samsung or any other flagships handle this (but one plus nailed it)(well I'm only talking about 4G, don't know about 5G).- Camera (Lot of people saying there are better options for me it's more than enough, Well I'm not a camera freak)- Display is good(don't know whether it's the best, but if it's in 120Hz mode battery is draining faster Currently I'm using 60Hz mode I'm getting almost a full day(12-18hrs screen time) in 60, but not in 120 it around 6-8 hrs screen time).What I dont like:- Weight- I actually like smaller screens but yeah I can adjust with it.- It's heating (I'm not sure about the measurements but I can feel that heat) when browsing a lot, downloading big files, the hotspot, little gaming(coc), and charging (In the youtube reviews they're saying it's fine but for me I don't feel like it's fine.)

  By reading the other reviews, I don't understand how people are facing so many issues some looks fake to me.However its been 15days now since i am using this device and following are my observationsPS:- I am transitioning to this device from my Oneplus 6 before that i used oneplus 2 & 3 so this is my 4th Oneplus device1) Display 120hz pretty smooth and fluid, you wont be able to switch back to 60hz now. Pro or Con you decide ðŸ˜…2) Performance is top notch (mine is 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage variant) so no complaints on that.3) Camera is not bad, pictures are of good quality in both normal and night mode, but if you are a pro photographer and need pro features then camera is not for you, for a regular user this is good.4) Battery:  Backup is way too good as compared to my OP6, the battery last easily for a day with regular usage it gives me around 7 hrs of SOT, but while playing heavy games like COD it gives you 5 hrs straight gameplay on a full charge (Rarely people does this until you have lots of free time ðŸ˜). Anyways when the battery juice is low it takes just 30-35mins to full charge which is the best feature for me.5) Networking:- Although we cannot test the 5G yet in India but i have noticed the Wifi speed and mobile network speed is slightly improved from my previous OP6.6) Software: Well Oneplus is always best in the software updates, however initially this new Oxygen OS 11 was a bit annoying compared to the previous versions, but it slowly grows up to you with the usage and u actually start liking it, there were few bugs and issues which oneplus is fixing with the regular updates and as even i am a Software Engineer the issues are understandable ðŸ˜, (i received 2 updates in 15 days) so software will definitely keep on improving which is a plus point with oneplus.7) Pricing:- Considering Oneplus is a brand now hence this price is justified. There are other phones with similar specs priced within 40K but they are not Oneplus, so just like Samsung and Apple you are now paying slightly higher for Oneplus.8) Design:- The only reason i dint bought Oneplus 8 Pro is because i dint liked its design, with Oneplus 8T that was fixed so 5/5 for design from my side.

  I really liked the device. Here are few of my findings.Pros:1. Battery Backup is better than expected. Last more than a day with normal usage.2. Hdr10+ and 120hz makes the display perfect.3. Network connectivity is better because of 5g support.4. Good looking Design and phone feels good in hand.5. Fast charging is a real time saver. I used op5 and this device charges significantly faster than that.6. Sound quality and loudness is apt. Stereo speakers are good enough for normal media consumption.Cons:1. Prime and Netflix doesn't support full screen and hdr as yet which kind of ruins the experience.2. Cameras could have been better. Although Nightscape mode is good.Overall it's a great device if you like flat display else go for op8.

  Before buying this phone i used a OnePlus 3 and I never had any issue with it but this phone has just made everything difficult.1.While typing anything, even while using WhatsApp, my keyboard crashes and stops responding.2. 80% of the time the dialer app crashes and I can't recieve or dial any call until i restart my Phone. So now I have to restart it 4-5 times everyday.3. When I press the power button, it starts showing the sensor is covered and the phone can't be unlocked until the sensor is cleared (pocket mode)These are the most common bugs that I have noticed after using the phone for about 3 weeks but there are MANY more small bugs here and there. I don't know what to do now... All I can do is advise the other people to not buy this phone. My OnePlus 3 is far better than this phone.

  Pros:- 120Hz Supersmooth display- Flat display is a welcoming change- Lunar Silver looks very elegant and professional- Performance is very great- Camera is good- Battery charging speed is insaneCons:- Purplish tinting when set on minimum brightness only appears while scrolling- Camera could be better they are using same old sensors which they have used on past generation of one plus devices- 10X zoom is bad. Seems like oil painting at that range- Phone gets hot while charging usually.- Battery backup could be better but charging speed compensate for that

  After 20 days of usage i need to say that the phone is really fast no lags camera quality is not comparable to other flagship level phones but does the great jobFew issue which i think OnePlus needs to focus1. Many software bug's camera image processing not upto the mark2. While playing HDR content the color temperature becames warm which is really irritating paid 44000 to enjoy HDR streaming and now I get this frustrating issue3. Many OnePlus feature like raise the phone to lower the ringtone missing4.Still there are many software in Android 11 os of OnePlus 8T I purchased OnePlus to enjoy the software but with so much bug's I am really annoyed now it's December 18 still no updates received.I will give this phone 5 star's when OnePlus will fix these issues via update and should do it earlier

  Battery life is superb.Charging time is much low on 65watt warp charger.Display is as smooth as butter.Processor speed is unmatched as of now.Camera is good but can be more processed, may be some Updates shall make it smooth, currently camera is not as per expectation.Happy to become a red cable family member :)

  I ordered this product on Sat night and received it on Monday noon , being a first time One-Plus user, I now get why people are crazy for this brand, the charging is super duper fast, 18 mins and you are half way through. 120Hz refresh rate is impressive but consumes a lot of power, hence I did switched it to 60Hz (Not bad at all). Camera quality is nice (I am not pro-camera person , so for me it did just the apt thing). Multi-tasking is peanut for this device, no issue with heating. Overall a super bundled package. Thank you Amazon & One-Plus :)

  Recieved it on 19th October. I upgraded my phone after 3 years and couldn't have gotten a better phone for 40k (after the hdfc discount). Love the phone, the performance is outstanding and overall best in class product. Would recommend.

  Please do NOT buy any OnePlus. They have inherent defect of calls not being displayed on screen and an OEM defect in camera focus.Also OnePlus is a Chinese company.I am now requesting for full refund as I am unable to see any incoming or outgoing call on the device. I can't even pick a call.

  Donot buy this phone for camera and for gaming, it lags a lot while playing freefire 8 gb ram is useless in this mobile, don't buy this phone for playing freefire and pubg, as I had a bad experience twice with same one plus 8t phone, even my iphone 6s is working fine while playing pubg,waste of money

  I am very happy buying this phone. Let me tell you my opinion on this. What would I look for in a premium smartphone?- a good premium build quality âœ“- looks premium âœ“- a good screen with high refresh rate âœ“- a good battery âœ“- fast charging âœ“- a good brand name âœ“- good software update and optimization âœ“- finally a good camera --- this is where I want to give a little more detail.Now the camera is no doubt very good and capture some really good images be it day light or Nightscape mode. Love the ois for video recording. The focussing ability is awesome. The 5mp macro lens is okayish and not a great. Capture kind of good image but definitely lacks details. The wide angle also looks good but not as good as the primary sensor.The software optimization for the camera looks very good to me. The image looks good after processing which is like super fast and doesn't seem like it is being processed (eg in pixel phones it takes like 2 second before you can take next photos).The front camera is also good and images turn out to be super good after processing. HDR works well with the cameras.Overall the camera is good enough to take awesome shots but again is not the best in category. But it is good enough to make it a complete package.Now who is this phone for?I would recommend anyone who if buys a phone and uses it for next 2-3 years if you are looking for a new phone you can definitely buy this. If someone who has recently bought a premium category phone in like last 1 year I don't think you are getting anything new here with this phone and should wait a little for new phones to come.The battery life on the phone is very good and charging is superfast.I have added a few shots of primary, Nightscape, macro shots

  Coming from iPhone 6s to OnePlus 8T. Review after 1 month of usage and on latest OTA update.Pros:1. Premium feel2. 120 Hz UI is buttery smooth.3. The weight balance is good.4. Liked the display size. Phone is reachable with one hands.5. Near stock UI is amazing and very smooth.6. Camera is great. I find all the 4 cameras useful. (After latest update)  a. The regular camera takes amazing pics in all conditions. I felt that the colors are little saturated at times but it depends on how people like it. (Try using google camera. It's much better than the stock camera). Nightsight camera is amazing.  b. The wide angle camera is great and captures very good details.  c. The macro camera is really great. Just one minor complain that it tends to blur the sides of photos at times.  d. Many people complain about the black and white 2Mp camera. But the B&W pics using the camera and using filters differs wrt to smoothness of pics.7. Battery backup is amazing after latest update. Medium Usage ~ 8 hours SOT (Social media, Youtube, News, Camera, No gaming).8. The 65W charger is very good. Don't have to worry about plugging my device at night for charging or pathetically slow wireless charging. It actually charges from 0-100 in 35-40mins.Cons:1. Amazon and Netflix are pre-installed. I don't use Netflix so it's unnecessarily using space.2. Battery optimization is sometimes very aggressive. Calendar/Reminder/Alarm fails to ring at times. Can be fixed with OTA update.3. OnePlus support is very poor compared to Apple. Logged a simple request on chat and it's been 1 week without any update. Have to rely on reddit community and OnePlus community for fixes and workarounds.4. The stock GBoard keyboard has a lot of bugs and gets stuck at times.5. There should be some option for enabling one handed mode. E.g. In iPhone 6s we have option where on double tapping home button the screen shinks to half so that the status bar is at the middle of the screen. Little things but very handy.6. Android Auto intermittently works. That's the problem with Android Auto I guess. My iPhone works like a charm with Apple CarPlay.Overall I would say it's a great phone and you can go for it. Update to latest OS as it fixes a lot of visible issues.

  The phone is excellent. Here are the cons-Charging isn't as fast as advertised, see screenshots.USB C at the brick end is a downside in my opinion.Battery doesn't last long enoughI'd buy a Nord if given another chance. The cost difference does not justify the difference in performance.Pro: Gave a download speed of 130 Mbps on Airtel 4G (4G+)

  Perfect price is to perfection ratio.  Only Con :- instead of Macro+Mono, it should be A Telephoto. Rest everything is as per my expectations !

  Advantage-100% charge in 30 minsDisadvantage - battery backup is very poor when using phone for facebook, YouTube or social media.Battery drain is very quick as compared to other OnePlus phonesWhat's the use of 30min charge which results in quick battery drainage

  I've owned a One Plus for the last 7 years. First I had a One Plus One and then a One Plus 5.  I've been perfectly satisfied and have had no complaints. The phone worked well, was sturdy and took great photos. All this at a good economic value.But the One Plus 8 left me wanting. It's just a good phone. I honestly don't see much difference between this and any other good phone. Photos are average, nothing outstanding. Response time is good. But many glitches. Network connection during calls is ok. The phone doesn't cast easily on a smart TV (or atleast mine hasn't yet). You're left with a sense of the phone not being enough. Maybe I shouldn't complain for the price I paid. But then it's not exactly a One Plus 8. It's like 6/7++.
"
"
  Had ben using 5T for 3 years and then upgraded to this. 65W charging and 120Hz refresh rate are the only proper upgrades that I'm very happy about. The camera is good but not great. Battery gives me about 4.5 - 5 hours of screen time and should easily last for a day. Yet another smooth device from OnePlus that's as fast as it gets. It's time OnePlus adds water resistance.

  Bought on 23.10.2020 and review as on 26.10.2020ðŸ”¸Battery life could've been slightly more better but overall I am happy with it.ðŸ”¸Camera quality seems little dull in low lighting conditions and even in nightsacpe mode I am not completely satisfied as it (OnePlus) claims (Not checked yet in normal lighting conditions, so I'll update later for that too). Not found any difference in 48MP mode and 12MP mode in normal camera.ðŸ”¸Device gets warm sometimes even in normal usage and that makes me feel scary to install Asphalt, PUBG, COD or any other heavy games (Will update later when I try them on this)ðŸ”¸Other than these things everything is awesome or you can say it's beast of Android. Everything is lighting fast and seamless. I have been using it for now more than 3 days and so far I found 0% lag. Performance is quite awesome.ðŸ”¸RAM management is superb. Last time I remembered there was more than 60 apps running in the background and every app I opened started exactly where I left them, so that's great I think.ðŸ”¸Storage and file transfering is superfast too.ðŸ”¸Sound quality is amazing, feels so real and crispy. Dolby Atmos quality is up to the game.ðŸ”¸UI is great, as I love stock android so OOS 11 integration with it quite amazing.Bought on 23.10.2020 and review as on 27.10.2020In addition to my above review I want to add few more points regarding issues I've faced after the 4th day of use:-ðŸ”¸I don't know it's the new Android 11 or OOS 11 but I found a glitch in the playstore, I tried more than 7 times to install Asphalt 9 on my device but everytime at 99% it stopped downloading and then there a error dialogue box pop up saying it can't be install. I changed my WiFi, cleared cache of the playstore but nothing happened in my favour at the end I rebooted my device and then I tried once again and it works this time. And it happened only with more than 1 GB data apps or games less than that playstore working perfectly. I am not sure whether I'll face this problem again in future or not but it costs me too much data for sure lol.ðŸ”¸In Discord when I try to edit any message it doesn't show any edit but at then end of that message there is word ""edited"" written but not any editing showing, so I've to restart the app again & again to see the edited message. It's really annoying. And in other apps too if I give command for something it doesn't appear until I restarts the app again. I don't why it keeps happening.ðŸ”¸In YouTube colour and quality is really bad. All colors looks very dull in any quality. I thought AMOLED Display shows you colors very accurately. More saturated, more vibrant etc but I am completely disappointed with this. On this device I suggest you to paly videos on 720p or 1080p quality for some better view otherwise your eyes will start to pain after few minutes of watch. And I noticed this in other videos playing apps too.ðŸ”¸Heating issue is getting bigger day by day. Without back cover I don't think I can hold this device for too long in my hands. It gets little warm while charging now too.ðŸ”¸I never thought I was gonna review about it but I don't think sometimes it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor device cuz games keep crashing in the middle of playing and sometimes when I play some ads for extra rewards. Sometimes games lags too. I found better performance in 730G devices. But this might be another software issue too. I can't say about it. Hope OnePlus fix these issues soon otherwise I've to replace it. I have two more days left to use and check this device before replacement windows closes. I hope you guys aren't facing these issues.

  This is my third One Plus phone after One Plus three, One Plus Six and now One Plus 8T.I didn't find anything new feature in the phone which excites.Phone is not good in network connection.Biggest issue is Heating. I already replaced one piece but the other one also have the same issue.This time I am very much disappointed with One Plus and Amazon both. Amazon also failing continuously on its standards.Will definitely try some other company phone in my next purchase. May be will try my old favourite Samsung or some other.

  This is my first OnePlus device, shifted from Moto G5s plus. One thing I can say that this phone is amazingly very fast, but not free from consPROS:SpeedPerformanceDisplayFast ChargingCONS:Camera: The camera is similar to old OnePlus devices from 2 years ago, so not a big upgrade, also OnePlus ditched the telephoto lens and instead they gave us a useless macro lens. (Samsung galaxy FE camera combination is better)Battery: Battery drains a bit quicker than expected, in my case it lasted around 5-6 hours of continuous usage.No 3.5 jack: If your old phone had a headphone jack surely you'll miss it. But you can buy type C headphone or type C to 3.5mm cable.No SD 865+ Chipset: It would really have been an improvement over OP 8 if there was SD 865+ instead of SD 865.Heating: The phone heats a bit while charging I noticed, although not that a big deal.Fingerprint Reader: It's average not too quick not too slow, but face unlock is very fast.Color Variant: There should have been a black Matt finish color variant, although lunar silver is nice, but I would have chosen black over any other color if I had a choice. (Galaxy FE has great color variants but Exynos is not a great chipset, you don't get everything from a single phone they say)Overall phone is good for first-time flagship users, I'll give 3 out of five stars as of now.

  Don't invest 46000 on one plus 8T as it donot deserve it..My camera is not working from 15 days n I hv purchased one plus just one month ago.Now problem is that In my city there is no service center.n nearest service center distnce is 300 km..due to which I am unable to service it too.. Without service center any brand is use less.

  I have been using the phone for around a month now.. I bought it as it launched and was skeptical if it is good enough for the cost but it has exceeded my expectations.1. The battery life is just too good. I use the phone for social media surfing and basic youtube use.. Still it runs for more than one day.2. The 65 W charger is at another level.. I have never seen such speed of charging ever and it actually charges so fast.3. The 120 Hz refresh speed is super smooth and along with the oxygen os it makes a killer deal.4. The camera, I may have not fully experimented with it but the basic i have used it is good for the cost and does what you want. I'll attach few shots for reference.Overall a perfect phone and checks all the boxes

  I switched to Android after 5 years of iOS. The reason was simple, costly repair price for iPhones. The last phone that I was using was iPhone X 256GB.After long research and review of predecessor phones of one plus (one plus 7,8 etc), finally decided to settle for one plus 8t 12gb Ram.I didn't had much expectations from camera quality, rather I was more interested in uninterrupted phone performance.The phone didn't met my expectations at all. The system has a serious flaw of UI.Every now and then I get notification that the system UI is not responding and phone restarts on its own.Multiple updates have been provided in this short duration from launch, but still the problem hasn't been solved yet.It has got good build quality, smooth interface, free from bloatware, but everything goes in vain when your phone doesn't respond.Trust me, I have never been irritated by phone as I'm with this.I won't recommend this product

  Got the awesome phone within 4 days. Its one of the best phone i had n the fastest. I m writing this review after using r hours.Pros :Great display.Great ram n storage.Fastest processorGreat camera n photos.Cons :Battery should be 5000 mahNo Type C to 3.5 mm jack.Call recording starts says sound...will review more after few days of using.

  Smartphone battery is good, but it's charging speed make it awesome. Processor, ram, storage, os are best. For gaming it's the best option. But the only area where it gets very little behind is camera, only a little improvement is needed, you are giving 48mp, while others are giving 64, 108 etc, but the real problem  atleast make your 48 mp better with software improvements. It started showing disturbance at full 48 mp zoom.

  Up to the mark product.  Camera is awesome. Charging  is getting  done in less than 30 minutes. Batry backup is good.  The price worth product.The only drawbavk with the item that you will not get headset.  So if you have Bluetooth headset then there is not a problem.  For avoiding  charging  of Bluetooth  headset frequenty I have bought Type c to 3.5 mm  audio  jack from amazon only.Awesome  product and I am enjoying  it alot :)

  Â Very sad to say..the worst one plus ever. The product has several issues. Don't buy.Every day new issue. Worst !

  1-- 120Hz Display.... Super Smooth2-- SD 865...Most powerful processor3-- First Device with Android 114-- Most important is Battery 4500mah charge rapid quick in 35-40 minutes with 65watt....it's amazing5-- No lagging, it is very clear 12GB RAM to manage highend applications6-- Now coming to Camera, is average as compare to price point but still it is premium flagship so you can ignore the same.This is my first One Plus smartphone, Ordered on the same day of release and got the delivery superfast by Amazon....Firstly I have misunderstood the word Dual LED which are placed on Rear Camera Panel. I have start torch only one LED was working so I have filed replacement for the same, then I got the advice and clearification form my friend who is techy guy and expert in smartphone. That LED which is placed on top is flicker senser not LED. So I have cancelled the return and finally kept the phone with me....It was very good support from Amazon as well.Thank You and Finally One Plus 8T is Ossam...Recommended to buy without hesitation..Finally Happy with One Plus 8T, recommended to buy
"

  There is no auto call recording function in it. Thatâ€™s why i donâ€™t like. Oneplus 6t was the mobile i used before. I thought 8t will be more better than 6t. But i was totally mistaken. 8t is entirely different from other Oneplus mobiles. Not much features is there.

  After rigorous use of 48 hours .Slight improvement in camera by software update will make this Phone flagship in all aspects. Display is really good.Battery life is good if you keep 120 Hz and ambient display on always you will get very much decent backup of 6.5 hrsCharging is lightning fast you will fully charge your mobile in 40 -45 min.Fingerprint scanner is verygood and very fast but still need to review it with tempered glass.Display is top notch feature of this mobile , you will highly satisfied with the display.Stereo speakers works really good . And if you have one plus ear accessories (bullet wireless z) you will have more satisfied audio.Summing up it's a really good Phone at this price range and if we expect the oneplus make the camera good by updates then it will be a beast in this range .
"

  This phone definitely a flagship and beast in performance that's for sure . Performance is top notch no complaints at all. Battery life is ok but could hve been better as it's having 4500 mah, but on the other hand 65 watss charger steals everything thing and am happy they charge insanely fast.Camera ðŸ“¸ : both cameras are good captures excellent pics.How can I forget the speakers , too loud and awesome display. In a nutshell.. close ur eyes and go for it.One plus good job ðŸ‘

  I am Pretty much impressed with OnePlus..no issues using it.but when it comes to Amazon these days very bad business tricks played.first I received a faulty charger but phone good so I replaced it with a new one..and my friend also order this phone he also got a faulty phone.battery dead.very bad batter backup.. don't buy electronics online..first ofall I wanted to buy an iPhone 11 in the great Indian sale..I even ordered the phone but after reading the reviews of that seller (appario retail Pvt Ltd ) I choose not to buy the iPhone..that much bad reviews and he is selling refurbished and clone phones...so I ordered this OnePlus 8t but with this also some bad experience. I got a faulty charger and my friend got aa faulty phone with worst battery...so don't buy electronics online....

  Pro's1. FASTEST CHARGING SPEED LIKE BOOM 2MINS CHARGED AFTER GETTING THE MOBILE ON 23 OCT 2020 FROM 12.30 TO 12.32. BEFORE STARTING TO CHARGE IT WAS 43/ AND AFTER 3 MINS 52/ THE CHARGING SPEED WAS AMAZING THE FIRST VIEW2. TESTED PUBG COD PLAYED BITH TILL 2.30PM NO LAG NOTHING FASTEST SPEED ON FANATIC MODE3. BATTERY BACK UP IS AMAZING AFTER PLAYING HEAVY GAMES FOR 1.5 TO 2 HRS THE BATTERY WAS AT 43 AND I THINK ITS TAKING 7/ DROP PER HOUR4. GOOD CAMERA QUALITY TOOK LESS PICS BUT ITS GOOD NOT LIKE THE PRO CAMERA ON MI 10 BUT ITS OK5. OXYGEN OS 11 IS LOVABLE I GOT IN LOVE IN 3 HRS OF USING IT. THIS IS THE FIRST ONEPLUS DEVICE FOR ME FIRSTLY I UPGRADED FORM SAMSUNG A50CON'S :1. LIL BLURRY IMAGE IS THE HAND GETS  SHAKED2.  BIG BULKY 65 WATT CHARGER  THATS ALL FRIENDS FEEL FREE TO BUY THE ONEPLUS 8T 5G THE BEST BUY TO A PERSON
"
"
  Meets all expectations! Nothing to complaint about it rather than I will say expandable storage..but still 256gb storage is more than enough.Performance is smooth without any lag or hiccups. Snapdragon 865 is a true multitasker. RAM management is excellent!120hz gives you the feeling as if you are gliding through the screen. Never faced any overheating even while charging with that amazing 65W charger.Camera was not my priority but still it is more than capable of day to day usage. Works satisfactorily in low light as well. Would have been better if IMX686 sensor was provided as main sensor.Haptics and sound quality is amazing!Overall I am satisfied with OP..My first OP device and I am enjoying the experience!
"
"
  If I see review while writing this review, it is reduced to 4star. I will not talk about performance as it is super and there is no doubt in it.As per my opinion this type of camera is not ecpected from Oneplus at 42999 priced phone. Really average quality camera in this device. Don't buy this for camera.Also battery life is not too good in my device. It lasts one day easily with average usage. Please don't expect too good battery life but 65 watt charger will be there to fuel it up quickly.I am not satisfied with the camera performance and phone at this price should have best camera.
"
"
  I would definitely recommend purchasing this phone. OnePlus has not disappointed me a bit with this phone. I previously owned a OnePlus 5t which also had a flat display. So that didn't affect my usage and the likeability factor of the phone. But people who used a curved display device might not like the display very much. But hang in there you will feel good after a few days. The phone, Itself comes with oxygen os 11 out of the box. Still needs to fix some app compatibility issues. But the updates from the developers are very constant.All in all this phone will give you a better value for the price you paid.
"
"
  Fingerprint reader is good....very Little slow... But u can't tell it until u observe it closely... Battery life is also good... Giving u a 9 am to 7 pm on 100% charge at normal use at 60Hz (never used 120Hz)... Value for money for its ease of usability, charging speed is awesome... Camera is also good...65w charger Charges phone within Â½hour Optimised charging stops charging at 80% automatically when u put phone on charge over night to avoid over charging or spoiling battery.

  GOOD BATTER LIFE but Where is the Oneplus8T complete package, there was no reviewers guide in the package ! I received only this box with it's content. We are supposed to receive the complete big box along with the Reviewers guide , one quantum bumper case and one more case apartment from transparent case . Have you all cheated us ? I need answers or wait for legal action
"
"
  Becareful, this is just marketed with warp 65 charging, 120 hz and rest isnt good. Poor display camera is bad. Quad cam setup is just a marketing jimmic. OnePlus 7t pro or 8 are still good phones when compared to display and in the same price range.
"
"
  Yes phone is fast, 120hz - good, display - superb, battery- ok full day goes, now camera give output like u brought 10k phone...Compared it with few samsung cameras of lower range..Expected at least if spend 41k then camera should have descent images.Better to go for this one if ur not gamer, else Nord is good if u want oxygen os, else go for samsung any mid range or A Series.

  I got it on the 18. Of Oct and using it for the past 2 days . The battery is great, SF charging and the diapaly resolution is great. But the only prob is its having some issues with Google drive backing up my what's app. Can any body tell wat the prob is. I hv also tried rebooting the device and reinstalled the what's a couple of times.

  Looks good. Battery drainage is there. But as os11 just arrived we have to wait to get stabilised. Yes 60hz makes it more longer than 120hz. They could he have given 90hz option which is absent. Touch, sound, feel, videos, gaming all looks perfect as expected.Water proof or water resistance could have been given. We should be careful with Mike and speaker as they are not water resistance.
"
"
  Review after using for 2 weeks:-Pros-Excellent build quality and finish.Fluid 120 Hz screen with no off axis tinting.Insane 65 Watt Fast charging.Loud and rich stereo speakers.Almost all day battery life with 60 Hz.Well optimised and near stock Oxygen OS.Cons:-Battery drains fast with 120Hz option, may need a quick charge in between the day.The minimum brightness doesn't go as low as other flagships, difficult to use in absolute darkness.The main camera is pretty good for the price, but the ultrawide is considerably inferior in terms of detail and dynamic contrast.No IP water resistance.
"
"
  Here's my review after using it for 2days.The main thing i like is Display smooth and buttery.Then comes the mobile build.The charging speed.The camera is actually an upgrade for me from my oppo A57 but i was not satisfied with the picture.What i don't like is the battery. It drains like hell when you sip a bottle of juice in heavy summer. I got SOT of max 5Hrs20min. The battery gets drained heavily even when you don't use the mobile.When i used this in 60hz there was an inprovement in battery life.

  1. Display is superb especially the smoothness at 120hz refresh rateðŸ¥°2. Charging speed is awesome...wake up..plug in ur 8T and by the time u get ready for your work, it will take less time than u to charge full..now my phone is free from night shift chargingðŸ¥°3. Form factor is also good...operatable with one hand at ease..and a good hand feel which is worth paying this much amount.4. Performance..I don't need to say anything..one plus is known for it and has set benchmarks..and they have done with this also5. Camera..it is disappointing...do not feel at all flagship....a bit over average I would say...65/100 for camera only.Conclusion : if u r camera centric do not go for this...if not it is the best u can have at this time..I got it at 39636/-. After all the discount.Conclusion
"
"
  This phone is awsome!!!! Battery life is very good while using whole day... it's remain 20% end of the day if not charge while using. It's 100% value of money because you'll get all the features, software and perfomance in this cost by other phones. The best part of this phone is processer and refresh rate. It's also working smooth on 60hz. So this phone is warmth.ðŸ‘â¤ï¸â˜ºï¸
"
"
  Everything from the display to battery, performance, user experience and even cameras are very good on this one. The Battery life with 120 Hz is surprisingly good. It takes excellent outdoor and night shots. I took this to a wedding and now I have the job of sending photos to everybody, it's that good. Stereo Speakers are amazing.Fingerprint reader is fast and 120 Hz refresh rate is there. One of few phones with Android 11 out of the box paired with oxygen os 11 enhances the usability. Stock andoid is clean but always limited by customisations and reachability. This phone sits in a sweet spot.Not one heating issue while charging or gaming. Finally this has almost all flagship specs at a very competitive price. My only complain would be lack of frosted glass back on my aquamarine green model ( not to say the green metal frame is in a class of its own ), and a very common looking camera module. Overall I found this to be the best deal.

"
  Was waiting for flat screen OnePlus phone since curved screens are a pain, been using samsung s7 edge since 3 years, still didn't get used to a curved screen.It is an upgrade in pretty much every aspect from my old phone but the camera is a bit disappointing. And the charging is fast but battery life isn't the best either.I've noticed that the phone almost never gets hot even when charging. I guess the new cooling system is working. It only gets a little warm while charging and gaming.Would've loved to see wireless charging and an IP rating but I guess that would increase the price so it's ok.
"
"
  If you're looking for flagship level performance and dont want to spend 50k+ then this is the phone for you if u got 43-46k(u may get for less after disc) also charging is very fast and battery lasts a day on normal usage.Flat display is preferred by many although the curved one looks better but flat will last you better so do consider that .. curved displays are expensive to repair as well compared to the flats.Only setback is the camera which is great too but not the best in this segment but anyway there's no phone in this range which will give u evrything best.. hence u should consider that if u just want the cam, I prefer performance and features so i chose it

  ONEPLUS phones are good. Service is too poor. I had bought a screen guard worth 1.3k from the OnePlus store and since the adhesive came with dust probably a defective piece. Asked for a replacement. Been behind them for almost a month no response. They just keep closing the case. So if you buy these ONEPLUS devices be careful not to go for any service as they are pathetic.
"
"
  I don't know if this is happening only with me, battery backup is so bad in OP 8T. Ive turned on power saving and without even touching the phone it drops 5% in an hour. I have to charge it 2 times in a day without heavy usage like gaming and all.
"
"
  Phone is good when comes to performance. Camera quality is not up to the mark. Camera seems useless when adjusting as per light. Indoor video shoot is also the worst. Night mode is good but very slow optimization of clicked photo. I am not happy with camera quality. In one line phone is good with fudu camera. After last update battery draining fast.

  Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, got this beast the next day. This is my first Oneplus Phone. At first I was confused between MI10T pro and Oneplus 8T. Finally made up my mind and went for OP8T. It was one of the best choice ever made. 120Hz refresh rate, Amoled display with brightness of 1100 nits!! SD865 processor with 5g, quad cameras, 65W fast charging which charges 0-100 in approx 40-45 mins. Battery life is good. Doesnt heat much while normal usage or while charging. No lags at all. Super smooth touch.Cons:Average cameras: 48 mp for a flagship phone! Could have been better, but its good. I hope it'll improve after some software updates.
"
"
  Pros1. Quality Display2. Oxygen OS. Smooth and fluid as always.3. Charging speed makes quite a big difference. Charges from 10% to 100% in less than 40 mins.4. Good battery life considering the flagship specs.5. Good call quality and network reception.6. Decently loud stereo speakers.7. Charger and case included in box. Type C to Type C charging cable. Can charge other devices supporting Type C charging (Max upto 45 W).8. Good weight balance. Doesn't strain your hands.Cons1. Average camera quality considering the flagship specs and the quality provided by some of the competition.2. Ultrawide camera lacks details and OIS.3. Low light photography leaves much to be desired.4. Macro photography requires the phone to be completely stable else it produces blurred and unusable photos.5. Lack of a telephoto lens at this price point is a big miss especially considering the fact that OP 7T had this option.6. No headphone jack.

  In love with this phone, its really nice & super fast.Interface - Got the Android 11 update almost immediately once I booted it up. Interface for Oxygen OS is clean. Not stock level nice, but NICE.Camera - You do need to learn Pro mode of using the camera for really nice pictures as the auto mode is just about ok. Or Snapseed every picture before socializing it.Fingerprint scanner - Didn't get any issues. Works smooth, no lag, even during rush hours at work.Battery - SOT dropped to 3-4 hours after the update. A factory reset is required post that to push up the SOT. Also, Intelligent Control needs to be changed to Optimize for the apps you need when you need them. Wasn't a big fan of a hundred notifications bothering anyways.Definitely feels like a 4 year ready phone!
"
"
  It's a really good phone! Excellent display and amazing performance. Im not a camera person, so I won't comment on that. After about a week's usage I can say the biggest pros are awesome screen, amazingly fast charging and smoothness of the operation. Build quality is top notch. If you're getting it below 40K post discounts it's a steal.

  Prior to this 8T i had 6T, After using the 6T i realized, the mobile means only ONEPLUS. So i waited for 2 year and bought 8T. Iam happy in using ONEPLUS. Advantages: MANY. Disadvantages: LESS. For e.g.: SMS deliver issues, CALL connect issues. The issues were resolved by reporting to CUSTOMER CARE. To my observation, i faced this issues only. Hope ONEPLUS will resolve this issue at their end itself for forthcoming releases.No other issues i faced other than this. GOOD ONEPLUS TEAM for your innovation. Keep it up.

  OnePlus 8T review:  Pros:- 120 hz display feels buttery smooth.- charging speed is like lightning (15-100%)  takes about 30 min.-  Oxygen OS is the best in the class.-  haptic feedback feels good.- comfort in the hand is well maintained(190g)- nice sound quality with dual speaker setup  and also good mic quality.- connectivity is unbelievable it boosts the  data and WiFi signals .- unofficial waterproof and durability.- performance is also good- heat dissipation is low (good cooling system)  Cons:- Cameras: no upgrade in the sensor since op 7  phone it's the same imx586 and the macro  and mono lens are of no use. It takes the  same shots like one plus 7 except ultrawide- Battery life is average 5Â½-6 hr approx(120hz)  ie screen on time or you'd get around 7Â½hr  on avg use without gaming on 120 hz ie by  watching movies and shows.- Processor could've been upgraded to 865+- No curved screen. ( Personal choice)- Bugs in OxygenOS 11 really annoys
"
"
  I have upgraded from 3 to 8t, I  didn't find any difference in screen. Resolution of Nord and 8t both are same and it is not that good while using apps. Other features are good and we are getting android 11 from out of the box there are lot of bugs in the software
"
"
  Fingerprint reader takes longer than usual to read, misses quite often too.A few software bugs and applications not being installed from play store, showing ""error: couldn't install application"". These may just be software bugs which will be fixed very soon as updates start rolling.No other complaints, Bang for the buck phone.
"
"
  The charging speed of this phone is super fast and battery consumption is also very good. I have been using this phone for over a month. And even after full day of normal usage I am left with an avg battery of 40-50 percent and sometimes even more.Speaker output is also good. I was using galaxy note 9 before compared to that phone the speaker output is very good and clear.120hz refresh rate also works as expected. I personally don't like to follow any brand like Samsung or apple when I feel they are not providing the worth according to there pricing in the flagship models.Gaming experience is also very good and smooth.P.S- good quality tempered glass is still not available in market till now. I don't want to buy â‚¹1000 tempered glass from the official website.

  I am one Plus User from last 4 Years my first phone was One Plus 5, which is working till now without any issue instead of Battery draining. However I am disappointed with Camera of One Plus 8T, my One Plus 5 clicks better photo then this one rest other things are good in this phone, but if you are looking for a premium phone for camera I would suggest to go to some other brand. As the Camera quality is not up to the mark.
"
"
  Battery life is very good after update. I got 7-8 hours screenon time on 120 hz. Once you use 120 hz there's no way you can go back to 60 hz. I have OnePlus 7 too but i get dizzy after 5 min of 60hz display after using 120hz for months or so. And silver colour is just spectacular. Performance is obviously good. User experience is very good . Os is clean.  Camera is good but not like iphone level ( iphone cost 1lack, you can buy two of this so don't compare). Overall at this price there is no other alternative or compitition against this phone.

  Camera quality very poor if you're gammer pls go with this phone.If you're love mobile photography don't go with this phone.Vivo v15 pro better then this phone in camera quality.

  Worst possible camera they could give in such a expensive phone. Look at the photos i have added, pictures are grainy and every pixel is about to explode. Also it requires to hold the camera for atleast 5 seconds after the shot to capture a stable image. 3 stars for fast charging and super fast processor. But camera is waste.
"

  Very good features. This is my first one plus device. OP 8T comes with an os11 which have very decent features like AOD. I used it for from past 7 days no lag at all.Pros:1. SD 865 processor it's very fast.Perfomance wise it's very good.2. 120hz display is very smooth3. Quick charge with in 40 minutes it's charge fully.Cons:Need to improve camera quality. I think that in coming updates one plus definitely give a update on this

  I am already using One Plus 7T, expected a better and advanced version with something great but sadly got fooled.Looks like One Plus 8T is an hurried mobile with nothing new to offer, now listed my 8T in OLX for sale as 7T is still working great for me.
"
"
  The face lock works a bit slow. The charging is definitely fast. It takes 40 minutes to charge 100% battery. The battery life can be a day when the refresh rate is set to 60 hz. When set to 120 hz the battery life may be less. Best thing is the insights screensaver. It shows how many times in a day you opened the app andhow long you spend in the phone.Also the work life balance software works perfect for your work from home- it blocks the notification from certain apps for a certain time duration which does not divert your concentration from your work.

  This phone is very powerful which is clearly evident from its spec-list.Let me give some pros and cons after around a week of of usePros:* Great display (120 Hz is buttery smooth)*Flat display (some like curved but i don't)*It has brightness upto 1100 nits (visible in direct sunlight)*Flagship processor (SD 865). No lag whatsoever* Oxygen OS 11 out of the box(based on android 11)* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected*65w charger Congress with type c to type c cabel*I didn't observe any significant heating while playing games*Solid build - Aluminum frame with glass back.*5G (although it will only useful in the future)*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1*Both fingerprint and face unlock is very fast* 48 MP Main camera and wide angle camera is very good*Macro sensor is also surprisingly great*Included case is goodCons:*I didn't like the 2MP monochrome lens(should have given a telephoto)*Headphone jack is missing*Should have provided expandable storage
"
"
  I suggest you to go with one plus 7t pro instead of any one plus 8 or 8t models.Issues:1. Yellow tint on screen.2. Lots of bugs in new android oxygen OS.3. Issues when connecting to bluetooth devices. Device turns to mute all of a sudden and you need to restart.4. Mediocre Camera not worthy. Quad cam is just a show off. Macro lens not worthy. Infact a downgrade from one plus 7t pro with no telephoto lens.5. Sometimes all of the sudden it says that apps are stopping.
"
"
  Few compromises were there. But good overall package for power users. Camera is good, but not the best. Especially insane charging speed
"
"
  1) I am highly disappointed with the camera. It tints the pictures slightly and the photos are not upto the mark.2) I don't understand the concept of warp charge. My old 3T still charges equivalent to this 8T and lasts a hour or so less than this. ðŸ¤·3) A good Android for the price but should have been improved a lot.4) All the good features are part of Android 11. There is nothing that OnePlus specifically added at the software point of view.

  Lot of issues facing from software side .I'm from Kerala .. aftersales very poor in Kerala .. improper service center .. don't buy OnePlus products..

  It's decent piece of hardware, but there are lots of bugs with Android I guess and happen to receive few patches on this phone and phone simply hangs after reboot and won't allow to login for sometime (happened twice after patch download) it gets back to normal after force reboot few times. Also the display flickers a bit just when browsing which is not good at all. Overall OnePlus should be able to fix this display, login n after patch issues.

  Â Op device ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥After using OnePlus 5 2 yrs, i bought 8T it's truly ultra display and ultra charging..one thing i don't like it's totally flat..so nt feel premium as compare to OnePlus 8 it's look premium then 8T..Buy the u don't regret android 11 out of the box first android
"
"
  Liked the way it work..overall smooth work. Touch and display r suprb.So fast ... And camera name quality is also good.  But the battery specially at 120 Hz. Doesn't give much better performance as expected.  But thanks to the 65 watt warp charger.  Very fast charging.  You would love it...  Specially the feel while typing is superb.
"
"
  Pros: Very smooth UI, Oxygen os is very good. 120Hz display feels great. There are no issues with the display like black crush, green tint etc. It gets fairly bright in outdoors. It handles every game I have thrown at it with highest settings(COD, Genshin impact) without any issues.Heat management is done very well.Phone doesn't heat up much during gaming. Battery backup is also good, I am getting around 6.5 to 7 hours screen on time with the phone. It takes around 40 mins to fully charge the phone. During charging it heats up a bit, but that's expected.Cons: I feel the camera could have been better. It takes decent shots in daylight, but at night it struggles. The night mode needs lots of optimization in this phone. I feel the macro & monochrome camera is just there to make up the numbers, they should have gone with a telephoto lens instead.
"
"
  Given the price point and offers, the phone is a beast is the least, I could say.120 hz refresh, bigger battery, the overall UI experience, everything is good. Specially the box came with every small things that you may need to start the device.Just that the camera needs some upgrade.Photos added are simple with no HDR or edits.Got same day delivery in Hooghly, Kolkata..ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°
"
"
  Â Up to the standard set by one plus.This review is after 24h usage. Screen time of 4.5h and battery is 50% now. Good battery life. Device got a little heated during the setup, but fine later on. Outstanding display and sound quality! Feels slightly heavier, continuous one hand use causes some pain.Have added the unboxing video of oneplus 8T.
"
"
  Switched from 6T to 8T 120hz is like butter screen finger print reader is super fast , battery drain is quite fast and camera quality is okBut the thing is one plus is promise to give performance and premium quality and they provide that........if you have more than 46k budget go for one plus pro or else it's the best in market must buy 8TAnd the best thing Oxygen OS. its best of bestNo compromise on OS all time favourite Oxygen OS
"
"
  This is my third oneplus device preferred this over oneplus 8 becos of flat screen and 65w charging.Even though the form factor is big the phone seems to be well balanced in weight.As usual camera in day light is good but when there is no light you can find grains when zoomed in.Final vedict: overall a good phone in this prize range which has no unwanted ad pop-ups.
"
"
  Bought this model (oneplus 8T) after using 6T for more than an year. But very disappointed with 8T's battery. Getting discharged very fast. One more disappointing thing is that the Call Recording feature. When we start recording the call, the caller will be notified that ""this call is being recorded"". Also automatic call recording function is not provided.
"
"
  To be very honest the difference between 7t and 8t is not really great.However if you never owned a OnePlus before but can't afford a One plus 8Pro / Apple go for it.Pro :1. Performance2. Display3. Android 11 OOB4. 120Hz display5. 65watt fast charge6. Increased brightness levels in day light7. New Oxygen osCons :1. Camerai. could've been 64 as samsung s20+ and many others are offering it at this pricepointii. Portrait mode colour glitch2. It could've had 865+ chip like Asus Rog 3 does3. Delayed delivery (got the phone nearly after 10-12days)

  OnePlus 8T - Post 2 months ReviewI will share ""my"" experience of using the OP8T for 2 months. Whatever I mention will be focused on ""my"" point of view.So, let's go topic wise, that I feel are essential in a premium brand like OP.Pros:1. Calls and Messaging :Â â€¢Â I will say that there's nothing much to say about this. It is the same old Stock Google Apps.2. Build Quality and Premium Feel :Â â€¢Â The phone is sturdy, a bit Chunky (which I would consider it as a Rich feel).Â â€¢Â I really like the In-Box Transparent Silicone Cover. It offers you the complete 360Â° protection. (I can say this because I dropped my phone from my 2 feet high bed in the 5th week).Â â€¢Â It protects the screen, with around 2mm corner projections and, the camera, that sits 1mm inside from the case's rear surface.Â â€¢Â The back panel, I extremely love that new type of Velvety Matte finish.3. Speed and Performance :Â â€¢Â Its really smooth to operate and I haven't noticed any lag since unboxing. That's anyway guaranteed for 3 years.Â â€¢Â I don't do much Gaming on phones. So I don't know much about that. Sorry Gamers.Â â€¢Â But this phone seems capable for more than enough.4. Oxygen OS 11 :Â â€¢Â That's the reason I bought a OnePlus.Â â€¢Â Cons are mentioned at last. Remember O11 is new. Takes time for further developments.5. Camera (which makes a phone Smartphone LOL)Â â€¢Â I was disappointed at the beginning when OP was giving shitty updates for O11.Â â€¢Â But after the Oxygen OS 11.0.5.6.KB05DA update, I started to have some satisfaction.Â â€¢Â Anyway, I hope it'll keep improving on coming updates.Â â€¢Â The NightScape performs really well.Â â€¢Â If U want to do Hardcore photography, buy a DSLR.6. BATTERY (that makes a phone ONEPLUS)Â â€¢Â I tested the WarpCharge 65 from 0-100%. It took 45 mins. And noticed no heating, just warm to touch.Â â€¢Â I recommend 20-80 Charging cycle to maintain the Battery life for a while. That's enough for a day's run.Â â€¢Â Though it is slow on other chargers. But good thing to remember is that OnePlus is still giving Charger in the Box. So, use it.Cons (Doesn't even Matter for me)1. Oxygen OS 11Â â€¢Â I can't see the OnePlus' inhouse apps like Messages, Phone.Â â€¢Â It is very close to the Actual Android 11.Â â€¢Â  But no extra baggage and Process hungry stuff.  (Pros)2. DisplayÂ â€¢Â Picture Quality is really very good and smooth for its 120Hz display. (Pros actually)Â â€¢Â The Cine-Aspect ratio works well with those videos with top bottom black bars.Â â€¢Â The sides stay blank when playing 16:9 videos. Anyway u can zoom to fill screen, but videos are cut at top and bottom.Â â€¢Â In some apps like Prime, max full screen is till the location where the punch hole Camera sits. This happens in most of the games too that I play for leisure.I might have missed about some features. But it doesn't matter much.So far, my phone is Justifying my investment. That's all I can say.Good Luck.

  I brought this phone as a gift to my wife , it's been one month now and yes this phone is good.She had Mi note 7 pro so from that to this is a good upgradation but not great for oneplus 7 , 7t or 7 pro users because the features are somewhat same .As per me :-1.Great phone for gamer or those who have work from phone or for social networking.2. Battery is great doesn't heats up and get charged very fast3.camera is good not best , for a pro photographer it's not good but for an amateur its very good.4. As there is no telephoto lens, to zoom and take a photo is not that great gets blurred image.So I can say I liked it overall in all aspect .( processor , price , camera , battery ). It's a good one even better than oneplus 8.
"
"
  Pros1. 65W charging: 0 to 100 percent in 30min.2. Powerful performance: No lagging whatsoever3. Refreshed Oxygen OS UICons1. No IP68 certification2. No 3.5 mm jack
"
"
  I have been using OnePlus products since some years and this has to be fantastic just like any other with the main reason of my purchase being the 'Oxygen OS'. The fingerprint reader had some issues while setting up the fingerprint but thankfully OnePlus has updated it in software update. Build, design and looks is top notch, especially with the Aquamarine Green colour (I have seen both colours). Battery life is very good with 60 hz refresh rate in display + the warp charge is very powerful.Apart from the fingerprint issue I mentioned, there are 2-3 things more like the Accessibility Menu Shortcut which is very handy & useful gets automatically disabled.The OTG cable of OnePlus I have is not being supported in this.To summarise,Trust OnePlus with its OTA updates to solve, but till then see the issues I mentioned.
"
"
  The phone is too good that I don't want to use it because me being to attach to my one plus 3 itselfDon't get wrong here 8t is hand down the best investment for a person who don't like changing his or her phone that regularlyThe only issue here that my issue here can speak for everyone here, I didn't like the headphone jack being replaced it was a big bummer for me.So to sum it up no headphone jack but a better investment for folks who don't like to change phone like clothes
"
"
  There no auto call recorder. We can only use recording option once call is answered and worst part is when we start call recording it gives verbal notification to another person on call that this call is being recorded.Flip to silence mode is enabled but it doesn't work.Camera quality is good.
"
"
  Â Best phone for the price. Amazing screen,the 120 Hz screen feels like butter.For the price you can't get a phone with better feature premium feel and beast like performance.The camera does lack compared to s20 but the 8t stayed on top for me because of the performance and battery life you get along with a 40min charging(I kinda have the anxeity when my battery drops below 50%) and the fast charging and carsy battery life helps a lotBut definitely not worth upgarding to this from OnePlus 7 or aboveFace recognition and fingerprint reader is fricking fastHaptics do lack a bit compared to other flagships but it is good enoughAnd did I forget to mention the oxygen is,it is a pure delightIf it is your first phone trust me this is one of the best option or wait for the OnePlus 9After 2 months The performance and batterylife is amazing but,it has difficulty in certain artificial/dark lighting situation.Also the biggest fricking cons are1) The fingerprint sensor after the last update is so irritating,like it does not work half the time2)Oneplus understood that camera matters and proceed to team up with Leica,the same company associated with huawei for camera which means the 8t will suck compared to 9,so I'm probably gonna buy that when it comes out and you should too

  Very bad experience  with Amazon they deliver 7t rather then 8tFirst fake charging time as displayedScreen is good but refresh rate is lessNo recording available

  I haven't really figured out why or how I am squeezing the value of the money I have spent on this phone. I still do the same things - Scrolling on web, YouTube, Social media use, Calling and stuff. All the typical basic user stuff along with some Alto's Odyssey on the side thrown in. It was this or the pixel but the 5 didn't come to India ffs. In the time while I figure out how this phone is a better fit for me than my Huawei Honor 9n with which I was perfectly happy with, here's my slight take on this device which I have made like a tank with the UAG Armour.The good -DisplaySpeakersDesign*Magical Charging*The Average -CamerasThe Bad -Size of this Thing.Network issuesAnd Slight mistyping issues at times.

  I'm writing this review after 10 day's of usage.Brought this phone on the first day of release.Overall the phone is goodBecause it has 120 refresh rate screenðŸ§šâ›·ï¸- everything is butter smooth.1 Plus has promised 3 years of software updates.Its OS/UI (user interface) is great when you compare with other phone's - its clean and not so non sense app's are installed.It's comes with 65w charger & u can charge phone just under ðŸ”‹40min - This is great.But while charging the phone produce lot of heat ðŸŒ¡ï¸- better don't use the phone while charging (a suggestion ðŸ˜)The worse part is the batteryðŸ”‹only last for a day maximum.The LED pannel is not so great as expectedðŸ¦§.Camara is average, selfie are great though.Its doesn't provide 3.5 headphone ðŸŽ§ jack, and have to rely heavily on bluetooth headset.Value for money ðŸ’°- i do feel it should have come between 37k - 40k bracketBecause nothing is new in this, it's doesn't come with 865+ Snapdragon, Camera ðŸ“¸technology is 2 years old.Doesn't have IP rating, like waterðŸ’¦ or dust ðŸ˜·proof, so you can't guarantee or be sure when going out in rainy ðŸŒ§ï¸season
"

  I just bought it after I saw they have a factory in India and they assemble it over here. I never buy Chinese crap. Turns out this phone is really good. Except I had to uninstall rubbish from this phone and spent around 5 hours optimising (like enabling dark mode, battery optimization etc) to stop battery drain. Now even with high brightness the phone hardly loses even a percent of charge with a screen continuously on for even 30-40 mins. Go for this phone.
"
"
  The phone is my first Oneplus device and it has impressed me quite well. The display is beautiful and crisp. The phone feels sturdy and easy to hold after putting on the delivered plain case. Opening apps are a breeze and the UI is minimal with not much bloat. The pics are above average in daylight and good conditions. The monochrome mode is quite fun. But overall white balance is still a hit or miss. And the camera software smoothens out some features that make some pics a bit unnatural sometimes.The charging is very very fast. And the battery stays for a whole day under heavy use.No IP68 rating, no hand gestured photo taking capability like Samsung. But overall, for the price, a top value pick and this is from a Samsung fanboy.
"
"
  This is my 1st flagship and also entered into oneplus family..If you want ad free and butter smooth android experience , u can blindly choose oneplus 8t.Battery charging time period is awesome, its completely changed my behavior. But only concerned part is very average screen on time.. apprx 6 hrs..Camera quality is drastically increased after couple of updates,currently in  11.0.5.6.Screen quality if top notch, very accurate colours, for sure u will not get disappointed..No heating issues as well played few high end games ..In simple word l, if you want flagship phone with over all bundle like camera quality, good battery Experience and charging , fluid amoled, sound quality.. u can select this mobile blindly...

  Day to day used: 5*Battery: improving on every updateUpdates: 4 updates so far. Bought on 17 oct, 2020, today is 4 Dec 2020Heating: was heating initially for normal uses. Fixed after updateConnectivity: great so far

  This is my first OnePlus Phone. I'm very happy with the experience. The best part is that OnePlus does not give unnecessary bloatware apps and give a very close stock android experience. The system UI is also very neat. When it comes to camera, it is simply superb. And the cherry in top is the charger, the phone charges approximately in 30-35 mins.Overall a superb phone I must say and definitely worth every single penny.
"
"
  Decent  phone but not worth  the value i think ...1 battery  is draining  like hell2 display  brightness is not that  much great  as they  have not given the option of  90hrtz which is problematic3 in my device i I don't  know about others  otg is not supporting or showing up4 netflix is not showing  the support  of HDRAlthough the phone is working smoothly  but these are the problem i am facing  may be they ll get fixed or not bother you but for now i don't  like it.... and i think  everyone who is spending almost 50k should  know these things ....in the end you don't  even have headphone jack also after spending this much money
"
"
  Â Got @ better discount. I like the charging speed and battery backup. And the back camera is awesome. OnePlus can improve front camera in room light condition, outside in day light it's great. Having issues with some applications because they are incompatible with Android 11 but it will be sorted when those applications will support android 11.I love some features like wifi 6, dual connectivity, wifi connected and you can still ON hotspot to use wifi network on other devices.
"
"
  A smooth phone as expected from OP with good battery back up and fast charging (though it has reached 58% for me instead of 60% in 15 min, it hardly matters). OS11 is also fast and easy with good camera output. A good phone at this price point.

  To be honest, i liked this device. I was using the 3T model and now i feel it has done much improvements in all aras except in the camera section. Images are not upto thw mark when compared to other models with the same price range. And i really dont find any difference with 4 cameras at the back. Main camera is the one which give syou the best pictures. Rest are not of much use.Display is fantastic, processor doea its job without any lag, its so fast BTW.Battery life is so good.. Last a full day and more even with continuous use of WiFi,games and video playback.Device looks great with glass on back side.Overall its a good phone. Hope they'll rectify the issues with the camera in the upcoming updates... Thats the one good thing about oneplus..
"
"
  So the charging speed and battery life is really good and I can use it for a full day without having to charge. I am concerned about how the battery will be impacted by only using 65w chargimg do I also use a normal charger while charging at night. After the latest update the oxygen os has gotten better but still has some glitches here and there, even the camera got a little better along with it. Ittl do whatever you throw at it and that too very well, was able to play all games at their highest settings without issue and suprisingly had fun playing games in mobile being a PC gamer

  This is a really awesome oneplus phoneAll the things are just at its best and also very well optimisedI personally feel this is the best choice among oneplus series right nowThe entire phone is a beast making its camera look small.....and i felt same but affyering installing gcam all your camera worries vanish ,its magicSo,this definetely is a real good buy for heavy users for a longterm

  It's an amazingly fast device which uses the ultra fast refreshing rate 120hz,I have switched from OnePlus 6T to 8T and quality and experience improvement can be judged very easily. The touch response time is very fast, and at outdoor condition you will face no issues as its having brightness of 1100nits, The speakers are also very loud and clear and the haptic feedback is also very good, like while you're gaming you can feel every vibrations pretty well and battery life in general is solid and it's also have warp charge 65 technology so no issue with battery life and last but not least the cameras also having decent performance but it can further more improved by software updates specially in low light conditions. So just go for it.
"

  First of all thank you Amazon for the fast delivery. I am from Kerala and the device delivered within 3 days. It was super fast.About the deviceI was using iPhone for long time and I was searching for a new device I could upgrade. After reviewing many brands I decided to buy this one. After just one day use I feel super comfort and feel. It's a good device and keep in mind that every device have its own pros and cons. This one have the same. But in this price range I am satisfied.Highly recommend. Please don't be concerned about the cons of this device and enjoy the pros which is better than any other brands can give in this segment.
"
"
  Writing this review just after 1 day since i am a regular one plus user. Overall performance is great (5/5). Battery charging is superb with 65 W charger. Battery backup is also decent even at 120 hz refresh rate. Built quality is awesome and 120 hz refresh rate makes it buttery smooth while using the phone. Stereo speakers also sound great but at highest volume the back will feel like vibrating. Camera is okay (4/5), would have been better as this price range. Reverse charging option may prove to be useful to many. Overall i am pretty much impressed with this phone.
"
"
  Amazing phone,but camera is sub-standard. Transfer the pictures to laptop and view actual size, you feel like you clicked with a 3yr old 5MP camera.Or just zoom it on your phone screen you will notice it..Battery drains fast.Everything else is great.

  When I open mx player its screen got stuck andThen black screen appeared and nothing was visible, this issue came the day I bought the device

  No doubt , fingerprint reader is extremely doing well and responds spontaneously without any time lag....Battery drain is absolutely not too fast as compared to other devices in this category.....And finally about camera.....Nice Camera set up and photo taken from this Mobile phone is extremely good.....all images have great detail including colour and pixel depth...Kind attention to screen brightness....screen brightness is at optimum level when you choose light mode.....but when you opt dark mode..... screen brightness is enough to look on the screen...as we know dark mode is used to use optimum battery and good to eyes.....so don't panic about screen brightness .....it is very bright.....

  As usual flagship killer. Definitely the 120Htz is buttery smooth, but disabled to 60 since it gives better battery backup. Photo clarity can be much better at this price range. 38 mins full charge is a major plus. Hope it doesn't harm the battery in the longer run.
"
"
  The device is great, no complain with any features but you see, it always lacks something that will make it stand out of the rest.Sadly, there is no such outstanding feature.Believe me, it will be great if you buy the Samsung S20 FE, which is in the same price range and offers better camera perfomance and features.Already having some software issues with the camera app and the Google photos app while deleting a picture, it take time to come back to the next picture, kinda lags for 2-4 sec.And there is no need for 5G in the near future, atleast till the end of 2021.
"
"
  Kindly do not purchase this phone. I received a faulty device. It's not even 1-day post-delivery but the mobile is heating to 54 Celsius and the battery is not charging at all. On the service front, I have been trying to exchange the product but Amazon keeps referring me back to schedule a call with technical service. Who will compensate if the battery or mobile explodes in the meantime? Serious issues like these must be actioned quickly instead of delaying. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PATHETIC IN THIS REGARD. NEVER PURCHASE ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. THIS COMES FROM A LOYAL CUSTOMER WHO HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AMAZON OVER LAST 5 YEARS.

"
  It's a beast....!!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥- 120Hz display is ultra smooth .- 65W fast charging is very useful and is as quick as mentioned by OnePlus .- 15min charging will give whole day usage .Battery optimization is superb .- 865 processor gives a upper hand to the gamers- ram management is very well maintained- camera could have been more better as this phone comes under flagship category but still the camera is up to the mark and gives a fine performance .Hope system updates will make it more better .- go to device in this range ..

  Don't see any effect of 65w charging compared to my 6t, also Battery drains at much faster pace. Camera looks good but definitely could have been better. Will write a detailed review in a week's time.
"

  This phone is a beast and let no one tell you differently. Been using it for more than a month ordered from Amazon itself. Except a bit of disappointment with battery reaching 10% by the end of the day after moderate usage I experienced nothing wrong with the phone. Camera is great for everyone, phenomenal speed, next level charging, No heating issues. Takes my phone max. 40mins. to fully charge from zero which I tested on day one, No game or heavy app that I downloaded that I have downloaded has ever lagged till now or has heated my phone too much. Hands down the best investment I made this year. I have the 12/256 GB Variant and I absolutely love it...ðŸ˜â¤ï¸

  Not a value for money product, poor pic quality

  OP8T is a performance beast overall....Oneplus said that they will provide support for atleast 3 years so you can blindly go for this....Battery life is Great...Gives about 7-8 hours of continuous usage time on 120hz refresh rate with 15% juice still left. Camera is great too...i dont understand why some Indian youtubers said that camera was not good.
"
"
  Rest everything is good about the phone. Only problem is the user interface of oxygen. It's quite difficult to move the screens from social media platforms. Many a times we have to close all the windows to really get back to home page. Rest camera, battery back up, looks, charging speed is excellent.
"
"
  This is my first device from OnePlus where I have dreamt a lot to own oneself for me a very long, I waited for the day and even skipped the Op8 since it has mixed reviews in terms of camera and some other portions, I trusted oneplus would rectify the negative from their predecessor and bring the 8t to the market...... atlast yes it done the same it corrected everything packed with the elegant flagship ... and I picked this one eagerly... It's amazing through the camera and the jumbo fast charging in 40mins zooooh... you can barely pick the cons.. but it will take no room for skipping this one from buying.

  I would not review the specs and other details which are easily available in other reviews, would just like to share my experience.This is a flagship phone! Truly premium and rich. For someone who requires a great processor and a great camera, this serves the purpose. I am an amateur photographer and I was very happy with the reproduction of natural scene by sensors like these! The ultrafast charge and a battery that stays more than a day with mid heavy usage, is the need of the hour. I can manage my tasks at office and home with still more juice left. Gamers, with a refresh rate like 120Hz, I need not say more. To summarise, go ahead if you have the budget and the need. Definitely a great product!

  Please don't buy the device. Network reception issue. I was a die hard fan of OnePlus till recently. I had owned OnePlus 3, 3T, 5 & 6T. I purchased OnePlus 8T but had to return it after few days of use as calls gets automatically disconnected. If I switch my sim to OnePlus 5, there was no problem with network reception. I had to finally return the device.After returning OnePlus 8T, I purchased OnePlus 8 offline and I still own the same. To my amusement, OnePlus 8 also has the same network reception issue. Unfortunately, I'm not able to return my phone due to return policy issues. Please don't waste your money on OnePlus phones.

  Pros -Fast Charging, takes 35 mins to full charge.Battery backup, getting around 5.30hrs of SOT with dual sim, gps, bt, wifi on all the time. Total getting around 20hrs of usage until battery falls below 20%Smooth and lag free interfaceCons -Network issues_with both Airtel and Jio... Not sure if is only for my device. Unable to hear anything both for incoming and outgoing sometimes. need to call again to work.Display is not as good as pro models.Camera needs improvement.Charger dock is still bulky.Weight could further be reduced, feeling bulky to handle as it is not curved.

  I havs been a a constant customer. After buying oneplus 8T, I am not at all satisfied with the battery backup and camera quality. Battery draining too fast. Also, within 2 days of buying the phone my phone started hanging and on contacting the technical team they asked me to download app named as blanco and they tried to solve the issue through that hkwever even their app blanco was also crashing and later on they replaced my handset. In the new handset alao battery is draining like anything. Not up to the mark. Would not recommend anyone to buy this.

  Have been using the phone for last 1 month and have had a good time and experience. Have read a lot of negative reviews and agree to some(only Camera quality is something that they could and should have upgraded). Given the price point at which it is offered/available, it is a STEALHave been a 1+ 6 user before and because of the overwhelming past experience had decided to upgrade to 1+ ONLY. The speed, response time, Display, good battery hours(thanks to the recent OTA update) with decent SOT(Screen on Time) is commendable

  battery drains very fastperformance is goodback camera is goodfont camera is good but in good light conditions in low light it performs very bad .it charges in less than ,45 minutes .speakers were great .

  The phone looks great in shape and the grip is really good. Feels like a premium phone in hand.Performance is fast and great.WiFi connectivity is awesome.The only problem I faced is that the screen FPS drops suddenly and I experienced sudden lags almost 5-6 times. I purchased on launch day, idk why itâ€™s happening maybe itâ€™s because of some faulty app or the phone is defective.But I cleaned some apps so letâ€™s see what happens next.

  It's my first OnePlus phone as I was waiting for the fast charge 65W with OnePlus for a thousand years.I was concerned about Battery draining but to my surprise, IT IS DOING AN AWESOME JOB and doesn't drain that quickly. Even on 120 Hz.Love this screen. OMG!Charges in 41 mins completely.SAR levels checked.Front camera quality needs a slight improvement.Phone feels premium in hand. Haptic feedback is absolutely painless.I am so happy to join OnePlus community finally.Thanks!

  I upgraded from oneplus 3t. The difference is huge.Display and audio quality are really amazing.I did not feel that the charging is fast enough as my oneplus 3t also charges at similar speed.Macro camera is not up to the mark, but then why would they give everything which oneplus 8pro has, at a lesser price.Ultr wide and Nightscae photos are good. I added a few samples as well.
"
"
  A major let down to the oneplus name . My old OnePlus 5t has a better performance than this phoneBelow average camera . Freezing issues and poor battery life . Wait out for the next one plus . Skip this oneTrust me one plus Nord is better than spending extra 15 k on this

  Everything is so smooth in this segment. I have upgrade my device from oneplus 6 to 8t.Starting from display it's super duper smoothOxygen os is my all time favourite with android 11 out of the boxCamera is improved if i compare this with op6Battery is too good and charging is just wow charged my device from 1 to 100 in just 39min if someone having issue please turn off optimised charging from battery sectionAbout 5g I can't predict because it's not yet launched in india.Only one issue it's not having any ip rating but oneplus said that it can survive raindrops.

  After transferring all the data from my one plus 6 n fully charging the phone with 100% n reducing the refresh rate to 60%6 hrs later my battery is 14% with 2Â½ hrs of screen time.Seriously disappointed with battery performance.Reducing charging time to 40 mins has also reduced the overall ðŸ”‹ performance.

  This phone has bug which results in increased call drop.9 out of 10 calls gets dropped within 1 minute.Buy this only if you want to use it for purpose other than calling.

  I just bought the phone 10days before and really disappointed with the phone.I have been using one plus for the past 5yrs and never faced such issues earlier.The phone is getting restarted every 10mins automatically.The camera quality is poor and not a standard one plus camera.The batter life is poor.U wanted to return/replace this phone but Amazon closed the return window within a week of the delivery.But within 10days the phone is getting restarted every 10mins.Request Amazon to return /replace the product.
"
"
  Equipped with the best charging technology 0-100 in 45 min, along with 120hz refresh rate on smooth display on a Android 11 platform which is rare to get at the price OnePlus offers, this is my first T series very happy with an upgrade but I think they should have provided a good camera upgrade for this version, if ur looking for a camera upgrade sorry it's pretty standard but rest all is perfect and fast.
"
"
  Light weight phone. But Main camera is third class. Front camera is good may be due to face unclock. Google crome not working properly. After sometime Crome gone hang. Need to restart Crome. I just want to tell. Don't pay for 120 refresh rate. Otherwise this phone not a value for money if you want to pay 45999 for 12GB. I am not recommended this phone for person who want to capture good pictures in phone.
"
"
  Here is my honest review for One Plus 8T, product is dusty, it's bad not at all worth 43k, instead I would go buy an iPhone for all that matter. It lags contrary to what the brand says, cannot run android apps (I don't know if there are any software bugs involved), shut down frequently. Come on, the camera is not that great. Even if I would buy a phone in android zone why not go for Xiaomi.No Pros that make it stand out from Nord; cons that make you value pros of Nord (of course budget-wise), in upper case; allow you to value iPhone the most

"
  It's a beautiful phone!I am really happy with my purchase. I moved from OnePlus 5T to this one and I am satisfied with the specs this one offers.Although, people are saying that the camera is not great, I believe the camera is superb. Tried the slow-mo and the potrait shots. They were good.The battery life is just simply brilliant. I never have to worry about the battery dying or waiting for it to charge. It is super quick.The screen display is wonderful and I enjoy watching Netflix on it as it takes up the whole screen.All in all, this phone is totally worth the hype and the price. Go for it!
"
"
  Well I'm using 1st time any OnePlus product and I'll give 9/10 overall rating. It's smooth and fastest gadget I've ever used. Display seems like buttery smooth and it's weight balance is also done well. The only reason I didn't give full marks is due to its camera and image processing. It's good and comparable to other flagship but not what OnePlus is upto. Hopefully they will give any software update to fix certain bugs. If you're having budget around 40k then definitely go for it.
"
"
  Battery life not good when compared with other existing one plus, it's drain very short period when compared with other existing. But it's not a big concern, reason 65W fast Charing is bringing back with 40min-1hr to 100%. But still may expect it's will address in the upcoming updated I guess.
"
"
  Writing review after 2 months of usage:Good specifications on paper but this is certainly not a flagship mobile.Overall performance is as good (or bad) as any mid range phone (20k price range phone).Especially back camera pictures quality is below par. Slow motion video features in low light is a big flop.Rest everything is good.
"
"
  Hi I have purchased the phone on first day of the sale. Phone is very smooth running and build is awesome and feel light while using in hand , display is smooth and performance is fast and gaming experience is good . Excellent battery backup you can quickly change entire phone in 38 min. Overall this phone is best and value for money.

  Review after 5 days usageGood Ram managementThe phn becomes a little warmer while on charge it is obvious because of 65w chargingNo heating issue while playing high end games like COd & Asphalt 9.Good battery backup last a dayFull charge from 0 to 100% in just 35 minsEverything is excellent except cameraEdge detection is very bad in potrait modeCamera should be  need to to be fixedOtherwise phn is beast.

  There was battery life endurance and heating problem on first few days of usage , then a software update came which fixed them and improved camera slightlyI prefer to use gcam for best results for photographs , for video stock camera seems very goodOverall best purchase I have done , performance is top notch don't worry about hanging or slowing down for years , 120 fps optimization update still didn't come , After we get that update this phone is a gaming monster
"

  Not happy with the quality of the screen. It's brightness in the dark is somewhat disturbing. Also tint of green light is coming from the bottom right corner on some dark screen apps.
"
"
  OP8T is a fabulous device to own. With the latest Snapdragon processor the operation are smooth.The battery gets drained but use a slow charger for better battery life, tried and tested.Screen on time is around 8-10 hours depends on usageThe best part is camera. Only problem is the night shots gets edited in a blue background. Can be improved via software updates.Worth investing. Go for this phone.
"
"
  Highly recommended for people who want to have a superfast phone. It is best for gaming and has flat screen so u can easily get a compatible tempered glass and cases. Battery backup is good with 120hz turned on it gave me always around 6.5 hrs of screen on time can be even high if 60 hz is turned on. Full charge in 39 mins.

I ordered lunar Silver on very first day of the sale, The day I got my phone from then till now i.e my experience is just fantastic,120Hz scrolling is way smoother than what I was using in samsung from last four years,scrolling and gaming experience is amazing.Best battery life by OnePlus till now among all of their flagships..Yes it's OnePlus Faster than ever.ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥**""ULTRA STOPS AT NOTHING""**

  Awesome phone with Android 11 one of the first phones to come with, 120 Herts, super fast proccesor for gaming, looks very elegant the aqua Marine color , bought the 12 gb ram variant 256 gb storage on the first day of sale.
"
"
  This phone is the best smartphone I had ever used.But the only problem is that phone heats too much  while using 120hz refresh rate and sometimes the battery drains quickly that is the only problem this phone has. The phone also charges with extreme speed along with heating the phone too much.
"
"
  Daamn! This phone needs more quality.I had 2 problems in my device:1) Purple Tint: The device display is having purple tint when you keep phone in dark mode with brightness below 30%. When any grey or black image moves there is purple tint in the edges.2) The device which i received had manufacturing defects. The display screen and the body was bit separated. I could see the glue which was put in between screen and the body. Noticed it when i opened the box
"

  Its so lightweight and compact. Battery drains easily compared to other 4500mah in the class,but with 65 w charger it is very well compensated.

  Everything is good except battery life.even though it charges to 100 percentage within 40 min..it draining so fast.maximum 20 hours it withstand.rest every thing is good and i loved the performance and display.and they should have given some good case and ear pads for this price.camera quality can be upgraded.

  All is well but the problem is call recording..if we make a call there is no auto recording...and if we touch the call recorder which show on screen for the both side it is telling YOUR CALL IS RECORDING NOW. & And if we end the call again it is saying YOUR RECORDING IS ENDED NOW.
"
"
  It is worth spending the money on this phone. The performance and the processor are top notch. The camera could have been a bit better but still it is amazing. The Refresh Rate just gives a wholr different feel and the smoothness just gives joy. The battery could also have been a bit bigger but the 65 W charger covers it up with its amazing charging speed. Nonetheless it is an amazing buy and an amazing experience for using the Oxygen OS for the first time.
"
"
  The phone runs smooth with Android 11 update. The charging is way too fast. Camera quality is decent and selfie camera also delivers good results.With heavy usage, battery may drain out by late evening/night but hard to expect 24 hours lasting battery power. Overall, a great phone
"
"
  It is a great phone with amazing performance. Battery life is good and charging is superfast. Display is also amazing with that 120Hz refersh rate. I did not see any display issue like black crush or any color tint. Camera is not that good though, that is the only weak link. Giving one star less only for poor camera.
"
"
  This is pathetic phone, never expected from OnePlus, we have total 6 OnePlus phone in my family but this is the worst phone. Exchanged this phone one but still can't touch as it over heats most of the time.
"
"
  8T is a great phone . However it is not a quantum leap on 7T Pro. In some respects 7T Pro ranks as well or even better. Seems like 8T was launched in a hurry. The phone-software interface is better now but not fully stable yet. As compared to this Nord, which is a lot cheaper is an amazing phone and possibly best value for money.
"
"
  Just got One plus 8t from amazon....Silver colour is best which I had purchased in my life...outstanding colour,elegant...green colour is common.Built up quality is amazing.Screen size perfectCamera amazing as compare to Op 8Battery charging it like a running horse.120 fluid display amazing.Go for it !!!

  The best daily driver you can get under 50K.Benefits over the competition:1.Fast Charging 65W (under 40mins 100percent)2. 120Hz refresh rate3.Great performance4. Close to stock Android feel.5. If bought with offers effective price is pretty good.Cons:1.Camera could have been better.2.Wireless Charging missing (if you care about this).3. No curved screen (depends on personal preference).

  The phone's very fast and smooth with the new 120hz display.  Top notch processor ( snapdragon 865 ).  Performance's great . Battery life is good .  Everything's great except the Camera,  Camera isn't that good . One plus should work on their camera . 4 stars
"

  I was surprised at how heavy it is. Also it is by no means slim. The one plus I was using is a 1plus 5. I loved that phone and used it for 4 years. Will definitely need to get used to this one's weight. Otherwise , super fast and lovely camera!
"
"
  Camera quality is not good. Pixels are breaking. It's been just 12 days. When I visit the store for exchange they are saying they won't replace until unless there is an hardware problem. I used one plus 5 T earlier which was very good in camera aspects.  I heard most of the mobiles are having this issue with camera in 8T.
"
"
  Battery life of this phone is very good and can easily give you a days backup in full charge (Without gaming).The experience on Oxygen OS 11 is very smooth.The phones camera does a decent job but is not the best.However, to conclude the phone is value for money under the price range offered.
"
"
  It's been a week, that I'm using the phone and I like the way it feels in hand and the high refresh rate makes every task you perform on the phone so smooth.My personal favourite after the 120Htz display, is the warp charge. This charge technology is so fast I charges the entire battery in under 40mins, which is a huge plus. You got a day's worth of battery in 20mins charge.
"
"
  I am seeing lot of negative reviews here ,wondering all these reviews are genuine..For me the the mobile is flagship killer , I have been using this for the last week , 65w warp charging is awesomeDisplay and refresh rate giving me a premium feel.Performance, no wordsJust go for it
"
"
  Oneplus dialer and message apps are not given instead it comes with old fashioned Google dialer apps where if we want to record calls then the other person also get notified that the call is being recorded and also it blocks the third party recording apps. This is such a downgrade for the oneplus devices.
"
"
  Excellent phone. One plus never disappoints. Excellent camera and super fast charging. Fast os. Would definitely recommend it
"
"
  I'm writing this review after I used it for 3 days. Phone performance is awesome. Super Fast. I haven't find any issues. It just took 34 minutes to charge from 15% to 100%. Camera, display, call clarity everything is good. May get bothered when you're playing some music with full volume bcoz you will get little vibration/disturbance from phn bcoz of high volume. Android 11 UI is fantastic, very easy to navigate to other apps r options & also some new features in Android 11. Overall, it's worth the money.

  Phone is good in daily task,Pros,1 charging speed is very good2, good to use it's smooth3 battery is good4, camera is average, may be improoved after updates5, oxygen  os11  is goodCons.1 phone's build qulity is good but it's display is not upto the mark it  doesn't feel premium personally to me.2.price is high,This is my first flagship of phone & I decided to go with one plus, till date phone is good but not  best. May be improved after updates
"
"
  I used real me 5 before switching to this phone. The cam clarity and display was so good compared to real me. But the convenience tools real me offers is not even in the near sight of this phone. It lacks assistive ball, quick contacts to make calls like smart assistant. It doesn't have a double tap sleep option. The battery is charging too quick and also draining quick too. Gaming was good.i played FIFA official game. Wish they update the phone with new system update with necessary convenience tools.
"
"
  Best from OnePlus.I am not a fan of curved screen. OnePlus 8t with flat screen was kind of a surprise and that's the one what I was expecting. I guess OnePlus has given a great response to their fan base by giving flat screen.I was using Nord ,the screen was pathetic and was having pink tint issue I returned that one and bought OnePlus 8t . It does not have problem like pink tint or Black crush. Charging is super fast. And doesn't have heating issue at all.
"
"
  Excellent phone wrt design, OS, Display. No lagin processor even at high size and graphics gaming.Battery draining slightly faster than exception and get 6 hours of screen time at 60Hz refresh rate.If you are looking for excellent camera, go for iphone only (I was used iphone earlier) but price difference is huge. After clicking of photo, processing time it more. This is not noticeable even at old iphones also.If looking for mid budget phone, this will not regret you.
"
"
  The phone comes with a software glitch, post getting updated to android 11, 8t is not even able to download or upload even apps like OnePlus gallery, COD, Asphalt, etc.After paying 43000. You don't even get to download or upload basic things. That definitely is a huge mistake made by OnePlus.

  Â I bought this phone for it's camera and fast charging. OnePlus has literally produced a master-piece. I am very happy with the purchase, the phone looks and feels super premium. I was confused between S20 Fe, pixel 5 and OP8t, I am certain that this is the best choice.

  Absolutely this phone is another flagship from OnePlus.I used one plus 8 also but in this phone 120hz s make happier more than 8.I totally fall in love. you feel amazing charge and speed of charging. I say this is the fastest charger of world.Charger speed seems like data transfer speed.One thing distracted me like when u use one plus 8t heavier then u felt that your phones temperature goes high.Finally I say one plus 8T is better then one plus 8.

  After using 6 days overall mobile performance is good but battery life should be better and also they have to provide 90hrtz instead of having 60 and 120.there is also one small bug which I noticed is while using the mobile in high brightness conditions and at the time of using the camera heat is coming more from the mobile.which it may get fixed on further software update.ðŸ¤ž

Until I am happy with all these 3 features.Negative pointBattery draining easily if you use any VPN connection.Apart from this phone is excellent. worth to spend.

  The phone is good but not up to the mark. Atleast when I go with the price which is 46k itâ€™s not worth of that because a 46k phone should be premium one and itâ€™s not at all. I felt like a normal 20k Samsung phone or May b below than that. I do have one plus 7 pro which is outstanding but when I compare that 1.5 year old phone with this new phone performance I am not at all satisfied. I would request each one of you to choose your budget phone wisely.

  I am a fan of one plus series. I own at presnt one plus5 and one plus 8t. The one plus is the best phone i have used till date. 8T has gone further few steps to provide an awesome phone once again.

  OnePlus should have provided wired head phones alongwith the mobile. Couldn't find OnePlus wired headphones on Amazon and other company headphones are not quite compatible with this mobile.I am facing problem while recording a song while singing on Smule or Starmaker.. Tried attaching type c cable to my 3.5 mm jack headphones but in vain. Voice doesn't come out clearly.Even the Camera quality is disappointing.Battery life is good and so is the Fingerprint reader.

  Absolutely worth the price. Very light in weight with a flat screen and a perfect grip. Ulta smooth scrolling and amazing camera quality. The 48mp camera gives really crisp and clear images. Video quality is also excellent and meets all expectations. The best part of the device is the warp charge 65. Less than 40mins the device is fully charged. What more specifications can one demand from a phone? Already in love with the product. #neversettle #oneplus8t â¤ï¸ðŸ’¯

  Best in class performance. No lags at all. Very fluidic, buttery smooth display. Not the best but good camera. Warp Charge 65 is awesome. Impressed with Battery Performance. No issues with Fingerprint. Good to hold without a case.

  After an uasage of a day, i am writing my first impression:1. Battery draining off as fast as it is getting charged. I had to charge 3 times in a single day..2. Front Camera quality is very poor. No AI or beauty mode is seen, which is the most common feature nowadays.Over all disappointed with ONEPLUS 8T. Not served the purpose for which it was intended to.Will try for a replacement and again review the same..

  Guys, I know people are comparing it with OP8 Pro, but we common people will not be able to differentiate picture quality between them. The picture quality of OP8T is fabulous. I have attached the samples clicked by me and few of them at night. Do see the details it gives you.At this price, user gets the best experience. Truly go for OP8T.Battery also as promised charges the phone in 35 mins.

  120hz Amoled panel is ultra smooth with 65W fast charger. And with 865 SoC, OnePlus 8T is more than perfect. Camera is also good and with high sharpness. Perfect Flagship.

  Phone is fast and display is smooth, but all apps doesn't seem to support 120 Hz refresh rate. Camera is good but it needs software update for further improvement. Macro shots and Battery backup is very good and warp charge 65 is very fast.

  I am facing intermittent wifi connection drop issue in the One Plus 8(bought last month) and this One Plus 8 T. Went to there service center today and as per them it's a known software issue and will get resolved by reinstalling the OS again. But unfortunately issue is still not resolved by reinstalling the OS. Really don't want to spend my time by calling them up and visiting there customer care again and again after buying a premium Android Phone.

  Build quality really good....camera is also good in the price range..Noticed issue with network...poor signal..Still stable software patch is required even after 3 updatesEven though samsung is high priced..it's an allrounder
"
"
  Â Phone is overall good. But since few weeks i am facing problem in using gesture mode. The gestures of going back and home are not working most of the times. I have raised a complaint since a week. They said they are looking into the matter. I hope it gets resolved soon .

  Amazing mobile but battery drains fast..
"
"
  Such a great piece of technology to use. I'm using Oneplus for the first time and the UI is very convenient and easy to use. Cameras are amazing, I can get really cool shots even during night time. Performance and battery are amazing too. Really loved my experience with Oneplus
"
"
  Overall a good phone. Camera is not the best.OS and display is smooth. Gaming is amazing. Phone doesn't heat that much. Best thing is 65w charging. Good thing is charger included in boxðŸ˜‰.It's 5g ready so u can use this for a period of 2 to 3 years. It doesn't support wireless charging. But the fast charger makes up for that. Though there is no certification for water and dust proofing. It's not a deal breaker. Overall u get a very good phone at this price.
"
"
  The product is heating issue Also the camera is not good. it's average.And the big problem is phone is hanging a lot.Highly disappointed with OnePlus 8T . Please don't buy this phone. finger print sensor is slow to recognise and open the phone. Very disappointed with OnePlus
"
"
  I received OnePlus 8T yesterday and its working great since then. Charging is super fast. Camera quality is awesome. Type C to Type C cable. Audio speaker is also great. No issues as such.
"
"
  Good display & fast charing.First impression is good.After use experience will be come later...thanks.After one month use:1. selfie camera wants to be improve...2. No call recording options in background3. In weather app there is no location  Informatonn.4. Some application donot wok in this phone  Eg: YONO Sbi, call recorder
"
"
  One plus has finally bought some change with one plus 8T, 65 watt charge with 120 Hrz and awesome camera support, the night mode in camera is just superb. Its worth it buying if you are planning to switch from old to new phone, one plus 8T can be your phone
"
"
  Overall after purchasing experience is average. My data got suddenly disappeared which is completely disappointed.I missed that back side fingerprint scanner as it was in my OnePlus 5t, battery life is ok in 60 hz refresh rate. File manager takes some time to load all the docs. Appearance is quite premium. Built quality is good. Nightscape mode is wonderful. Camera is quite better than recent OnePlus series but need to take stedy clicks otherwise get blured.
"
"
  This review is individual review as every person will have own point of view about the phone for what feature anyone is looking for.As far my concern phone is definitely worth to buy.Official Purpose no lagCamera may lag with day light consideration if anyone not looking for iphone camera.Smooth operationGood battery life
"
"
  I did not got my replacement orderNeither Amazon provided same launch offers on ordering a new phoneTotal loss 1250 + one year of screen protection plan
"
"
  Bought 12 GB and 256 GB variant. Phone is monstrous and blazing fast. But, let down by camera. By the way attached images are taken by samsung Galaxy S8 which is 3.5 years old and still captures much better images than this device. Don't go for this device if you like clicking pictures a lot.
"
"
  It's for personal use.- I am a big fan of OnePlus mobile and have used OnePlus 1, 5T and now 8T.- previous both phone was way better from day 1 but 8T is regularly receiving updates and still not sure that it's complete. What's app not working properly send button goes away is many of chats and comes again once back button is clicked. Personal view.- however it's a buy for me.
"
"
  My fiance gifted me this mob I am very much Happy... Stunning performance of OnePlus 8t which I have ever seen in OnePlus series.... Awesome camera quality in night mode u can see the pictures which I have attached and sexy vibrant changing colour.awesome Product thanks to OnePlus and my fiance and ever thanks for Amazon Dil ki Dhadkan ki Dukaan.....ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
"
"
  What i say for this... Just one word ""beauty with beast performance""... I have been posting review after purchasing from first day of sale... Till now got 3 incremental updates and lots of things improved the 8T day by day... Such as network coverage stability, camera, and more...  Best part A+ grade display because i didn't get any display issue in my device.
"
"
  First and most important is its battery and the charging speed. It takes 40 min to charge full. Secondly I love Lunur silver colour coz it's very decent and looks premium in hand. I'm not a camera person but still it takes high quality photos and for normal usage, it's more than the expectations. It's my first OnePlus mobile shifted from Samsung and it tooks me to next level in mobile experience.  Must buy product if you considering more than 40k mobile.
"
"
  I loved everything about this 5G -super fast, super amazing camera quality, look and feel of it. Battery life is a major yayy...and to top it up its 65w charger which charges in no time. I am loving it.
"
"
  Fast performance, fast charging. Battery sometimes drains quickly but charges full phone within 40-45 minutes. Camera is not that good.Major issue: alot of apps are not supported in this phone. Its own GalleryApp is not able to update. Games like asphalt, freefire erc are not getting installed. Looks like took a wrong decision on this Phone.
"
"
  I was using before oneplus 6 from past 2 years. Addicted to oneplus bcz of fast performance and never lags..now upgraded to 8T.I must say worth the upgradeHighlets1.performance is like hell never lags2.smoothest 120hz3.display colors4.Ultra  fast charging5.cameraDont think of reviews...some people saying its getting heat...Trust me its not even touching 40Â°..ehile playing games also never lags or no heat..

  One of the best and top most India's premium Segment Smartphone, OnePlus 8T is awesome, just today on 20/10/2020 I received the smart phone, phone is very light in weight, display is awesome, phone is very fast and having fastest charging charger, Colour aquamarine Green looks superb, camera is superb both front and back, they give u awesome click........I am using OnePlus smartphone from 2017 and this smartphone is best in its class as of today..
"
"
  Upgraded from OnePlus 5T. Damn, that 120Hz is smooth. No going back from that buttery smoothness. Warp charge 65, chefs kiss. Muaaahh. Very much needed. Battery life yet to be tested. Packaging is pathetic from Amazon, the box had some dents.
"
"
  Too much of heating while using long time not recommended at all .I conversed with the Amazon service center they told to use one day but the problem continued and they informed me the service technician will come and see the mobile waiting to 30 th of the month
"
"
  Every aspects up to the standard of one plus. Good quality cameras, fingerprint reader, display, sound etc. Design is, I fear, slightly conservative, yet not bad. Altogether very nice product.
"
"
  Everything is good except the front Camera. The image quality is too bad clicked by front camera specially. Pixels are not clear like we are using 2 mp Camera. My OnePlus 5T was good in comparison for front Camera. Even though No Service Center in Mathura. Why?Please update the camera app quality in your next update in oxygen OS.
"
"
  Very much impressed with oneplus8t. There are no tint issues with oneplus8t. 65watt charging roughly takes 20-25mins to full charge. Battery management was so good. No heat noticed while using the mobile. Camera quality was good but picture quality can be better .
"
"
  Camera quality is good... performance of mobile is excellent....
"
"
  Battery is draining like a 2-3 years old phone. Battery backup is very poor and battery is lasting only for 6-7 hours even for the moderate usage. Expected more from 4500mah battery, but it's totally disappointment. My old oneplus 3t mobile battery will last more than this brand new onleplus 8t. Playing high-end games will drain the battery from 100 to 0 in 3-4 hours.OnePlus team please do the needful..!!!!!!!
"
"
  If u r upgrading from mid range buy this. Best for this price segment. If u even have OP7 then I think u still have a best device. Peace âœŒï¸.

  Worth money am getting good battery backup,ultra smooth amoled 120hz is one to experience evryone performance is  top notch no heating issues camera in some segments needs to be improved may be updates it should be solved and sound quality via speaker great call quality wise also no issues sometimes vibration sound annoying when notification comes but vibration mode no issues so far from 3dys of useage really satisfied.

  Everything thing is fantastic specially charging and refresh rate and one thing which i don't like is phone is very taller and call recording function is not available without voice.

  Three points1. Phone is getting heated.2. Selfie photos are not good quality.3. Time lag between click and capturing picture.
"
"
  The phone is awesome...camera captures slightly optimised pictures rather than natural photos...65w charging is just amazing....a good update for people with OnePlus 5 to 6t... Amazon service is also good...got the phone 3days before expected delivery date..120hz display is superb... phone looks super Premium.. speakers are loud and the phone is an absolute flagship

  Processor goodPerformance gooooodBattery and charger GoooooooodWhat's not to likeThose who understands one plus only can understand this device haters ðŸ˜› pls don't even say anything
"
"
  Everything about the phone is just perfect except the fact that I am experiencing battery drainage at a larger level.I slept with 96% and woke up to 92%.And with the delivery,the delivery boy misbehaved with me asking me to collect it from him rather than delivering it to me.He even told that he would return the package if it's not collected within an hour.He was an Amazon delivery agent indeed.
"
"
  All amazing features except the battery backup. But the battery power is not in par with other smart phones. Really skeptical why have they kept only 4500 mAh for such premium phone. And now they are advertising for Powerbank. Why would I buy a powerbank after spending such hefty amount on a premium phone.
"
"
  Amazing product from OnePlus. The image quality is amazing and the phone gets charged in less than half an hour. Even with high usage throughout the day,the battery lasts for an entire day. I was confused whether I should go for a OnePlus phone or an iPhone but after using this for around 3 days now, I can say that it is worth it.
"
"
  I am very disappointed with one plus team. one plus 8T is not good if you are paying 43kPlease go for other options if you are looking for better camera

  Performance: 5/5Battery backup:5/5 Wrap charge really awesomeDisplay smoothness: 5/5Camera: 4/5 it's phone don't expect DSLR level clarity with it but still not bad with pro mode and 48MP wide scenery photos quality really good.From 6T to 8T ,ultra smooth display 120Hz refresh rate with oxygen OS 11, really like it. Go for it , best in 5G class at price 40K compared to other brands

  Amazing Flagship phone from Oneplus. Being a OnePlus 3T user, it was a great upgrade!Wireless Charging is Missing! :(Happy with the Fast charging & Camera quality :)
"
"
  I recieved a damage product, There is a improper cutting at the speaker side. I'm regretting that I should have requested for replacement but I was scared because I thought they might hand me over a refurbished product and it's an emi purchase, If they had cancelled then I would have been in trouble. I wish I had took my chances. Very bad quality check before dispatching
"
"
  The phone has a speedy and swift response feedback to our touches. However, the front camera was lacking the quality expected. Also, sometimes the phone goes into pocket mode even when it's in my hand and it's difficult to go back to normal quick.
"
"
  Good battery life and super fast charging within 30-40 min. Fast fingerprint reading, superb performance.Camera quality is also good.Happy with this phone.
"
"
  Gesture navigator are not working properly. I have ordered 2 times in 15 days. 1st set have this problem i think that may be this set has problem and i replaced my 1st 8t with a new one. But surprised when i faced same problem in the new replaced 8t. Earlier i have one plus 6 which is far better than this one plus 8t . So think before going to purchase it. One plus has started compromising with quality.
"
"
  Worst battery backup. I need to charge my phone 3 times a day..rear camera is good but front camera is pathetic..it looks like a 10k Redmi phone ..i regret buying..better go for iphone 11 at this price segment..and a lot of heating issues
"
"
  I had received defective handset initially. Battery was not even lasting 5hrs for average use (No Gaming) but got replacement also. received device is perfect. butter smooth performance, getting 24hrs battery backup for average use. Tried playing few games without any issues. perfect phone under 50k. call quality is best. speaker output also best in segment.
"
"
  I like the overall performance of the phone and battery life and charging speed is really good.Only one this I didn't like is the camera which is not much to it stds.So I would really recommend OnePlus to start focusing on the camera as well.If it's a incrase of 2k rs to 3k rs, it's still good to have a better camera.Thanks Amazon and OnePlus for this awesomeness.
"
"
  In love with the Aquamarine Green colour of my phone... Awesome display with vibrant colours... Satisfied with the camera quality... 120 hz refresh feels buttery smooth...  Charging speed is awesome... If your budget is 40k and your old phone isn't working then close your eyes and buy this phone...

  Awesome Phone..! 120hertz Smooth as all time... 12gb in this price range is awesome deal.. Charging is really speed 100 % in 40 mins. Regarding Camera you may be disappoint, but may be in future with software updates it can be solved.Overall good performance, but while playing high graphic game with UltraHD settings might feel resolution getting distorted sometime, maybe it could be due to network issue.
"
"
  Fairly powerful device. Awesome screen, haptics, fingerprint reader, face unlock, oxygen OS. 65 W warp charging is the best feature, never ever have to worry about low battery. Camera quality is very good. You wont notice/complaint unless you are a pro photographer. Device is also good value for money. I am an advanced user and happy with it.
"
"
  Worst phone ever. The way oneplus is promoting the phone, it is exactly opposite.With premium cost u will be getting low cost phone. I have bought this phone after seeing good reviews from youtubers. It is the worst phone I have ever purchased.Major IssueWorst battery life. Within a day need to charge thrice.Worst camera quality
"
"
  very good phone. Lunar grey colour looks good. Iam getting really good screen on time and warp charge 65 is daamn fast... phone has a good weighted feeling... although I felt the shipping was kinda slow but it was packaged properly. No screen issues. No heating issues after playing COD after an hour.

  5g, 120hz display, 65 Watt charge, best in this range.

  Phone is good on every other aspect except camera.Design, Specs, Display, Charging,UI etc. Gets 10/10.But camera 7/10.Needs improvement in camera application.Macro and monochrome lens are waste.Should have provided telephoto instead.
"
"
  In hand feeling is very poor. Not worthy product as this price bracket.Built quality is very poor. Down grade one plus product.  Very disappointing me...blue color is looking vary cheap.
"
"
  The phone is amazing if you are into performance. I was using s8 before it and its a definite upgrade. Exynos is nowhere near Snapdragon. The only thing I miss about my s8 is its camera. This phone is capable of taking amazing picture but sometimes it just clicks weird pictures. The colors are not that much natural. Hope they fix this is next updates.
"

  Switched on to this from iphone 7 plusAnd I made a great decision rather than going for iPhone 11..If you love Speed get this you won't regret..Camera is good enough but could have been better at this price point120 hz display is super snappyBut I usually get around 4-5 hr screen on time... which I kind of decent with 65w charger which you get inboxðŸ˜…

  This is the value able product for who this is going to buy..I agree camera quality should be improve but although it's good.you can go for it.this will never dissapoint battery life is also good it gives me one day battrey life easily on moderate ussage . NEVER any of the accessories from one plus store..it's totally waste of money..otherwise the mobile is beast.ðŸ”¥

"
  It's fluid & smooth. You do really notice 120hz while using it. The screen is magnificent. However,it would have been a perfect gaming phone if there was 3.5 mm jack. The charging is superfast and takes 40 minutes from 5 to 100%, although I'm getting pretty average screen on time, but improved a bit after a recent update.
"
"
  Don't buy this... It is not worth. This quality is same as a Oppo mobile because Oppo Mobiles India is manufacturing this product. Camera and picture quality is not good. OnePlus has made a fool out of people. This phone is not that great as that of other OnePlus phones. 7 series was better than this. From the first day double tap(quick gestures) for screen lock is not working.

  This Oneplus 8T on Beast mode.Fabulous camera ,smooth touch, Battery backup also better .and display Quality was Amazing.I m a photography lover for me this phones camera quality best than other android mobile.

  Taking the google integration of messages app and phone app aside, the Oxygen OS is the best.OnePlus has improved their cameras and proved their fans towards brand loyaltyAmazon should be proud of having such stronger brands in their offerings.

  I was a fan of Samsung since 10 years , I have always used Samsung cellphone s, my cousin told me to try one plus 8 T newly launched, I ordered it on Amazon and received on time, using it is a very pleasant experience till now, right now not having any issues, will update if I have any.....strongly recommended for use....
"
"
  Using since a week now. Camera quality is good. Wide angle function is solid. Battery life won't disappoint. Charges literally very fast. Phone built quality is good but a cover is recommended.

  Very nice performance.. especially the fast charging part..Whoomfff. Camera is nice, however still exploring the part. However there are not too much of a feature that makes  completely unique.

  Overall a great phone in terms of performance and charging. However, camera is pretty average and doesn't suffice the price for 42,999/-. Otherwise phone is working pretty good and has latest Anrdoid installed with 60hz and120hz refresh rate options available.

  After one month of usage .. Just love the phone in terms of price better than op8 in everyway yes in terms of camera lil bit lag when compared with op8 pro but 8T has got some camera updates so image processing is good not the best but in 40k with discount on perfect buy.(This is my first in hand exp with one plus)

  If you are thinking of other oneplus phone camera quality in this . This phone is definitely not a fit.Other features are pretty good .Still not satisfied with images captured , no detailing , color scheme is slightly weird  when in low light .

  First of all it's a great phone with all the lastest features except camera. Camera could have been better for this price range.

  The phone is just wonderful, everything is so smooth, touch, performance, fast Charing and camera is fine too. Howeve, I am facing heating issue with this phone and battery drainage is so fast.Raised to Amazon team, waiting for their response!
"
"
  The fingerprint reader is very nice and very attractive with new functions...The picture quality of this phone is also amazing...But I disappointed with the battery life it's 4500 mAh the OnePlus makers should fix this problem by giving more battery life in the OnePlus phones...
"
"
  Great unboxing experience with a great phone at this price. 120 hz display is super smooth. Oxygen os 11 is much better than other operating system. Camera could have improved. Battery drain is quicker than expected. But warp charging is superb. Overall a great experience. My rating 8.5/10.

  Its good in all aspect i would say no consBut the best part is display, speakers, UI and even afer seeing the reviews on YouTube i extracted the camera to be average but its super good.Planing to buy at this price range just go for it, you won't regret.
"

  Very fluid touch and superb processor makes it work like a dream. Phone is light weight too.ðŸ˜. Best phone at this price point.  #neversettle. 120 Hz refresh rate 65 W warp charging  5G etc are the key highlights.
"
"
  Superb performance and very fast charging....this is for those people who can't wait for 1.5 or 2.0 hours for fully charge...it's 65 watt charger charges the phone in 40 min and speakers are also loud....so go for it.....
"
"
  Awesome phone if you are upgrading from a low end device(I upgraded from moto one power). Feels very fast. Very good battery backup. Within 40 mins it's fills the battery to 100%. Outdoor camera performance is very good. No complaints about it. But in indoor lightings it struggles a bit.
"

  In my carrier, 8T is the second mobile, which is worst, for camera quality I couldn't found its worst. But I was very Happi with my Oneplus6, which was my first mobile with OnePlus,

  Overall not recommended. Call recorder also not smooth.Kindly talk customer care before being
"

  You fingerprint reader initially takes time to add our fingerprint. Wipe it clean and try with a clean fingers. It works perfectly. After that you can't see any issues at all.Over-all a very nice product. Worth for money.
"
"
  This is undoubtedly the best premium smartphone anyone can buy, the oxygen is is superb , it enhancing the whole android experience, so many customisation opetions . One plus brings the best in the 'T' versions of their phone and that too without incresing the cost campared to OnePlus 8
"
"
  Cons.-Facelock not working properly.-Flat display-High price-Not much improvement
"
"
  The build quality is good. The phone is fast with good software experience. The battery life is also good. It can easily last whole day and if you are a heavy user u can easily charge it.
"
"
  Excellent phone, there's nothing u can literally point out that is bad in this phone. It's extremely smoooooootthhhh.
"
"
  The overall performance is good the only issue is Battery drains very fast even on 60hz refresh rate.
"
"
  Amazed by its performance and warp charging is just like a cherry on top of the cake. Refresh rate is also incredibly good. After using it for a week I feel there is no such problem with the set. Good choice for tech enthusiast.
"
"
  The online reviews have been quite right for this device. Warp 65 does charge phone for a day's use in 40 mins from 8 to 100 percentage and battery life takes a day to discharge. Sound quality is good. Only thing the camera quality just is not good enough for this series.

  Bought mobile 10days ago , updated to latest firmware. It has lots of bugs, issue's unable to download apps in play store. I am using apple and samsung not such a issues with those mobiles .But facing worst updates with one plus. Please don't buy one plus products.

  One of the best phones for the year,Only heating issues were thereOtherwise too fast and smooth.And an top notch camera quality

  I'm facing screen tint and black crush issues on this phone. One way you can check it is by lowering the brightness to 30-45% and opening any app which supports dark theme. The borders have a clear green tint and black crush issues while watching content on Netflix and prime.
"
"
  Very avg battery performance,drains very fast ...even in 60hz also! Didn't find any major difference between 120hz and 60hz..!If you don't worry about battery then you can definitely buy, performance wise beast....camera,display everything is good!

  Worst mobile body... Fake.. There is no response for ask questions.. No help from amazon..

  Camera performance very bed also not allowed call recording, selfish camera also bed quality,

  The product has software issues. Had to replace it immediately after buying
"
"
  Camera quality is absolutely poor. Coming from an iPhone, I felt the camera is worse than 15k phones available in the market today. Too much flickering while takimg videos and photos. Slow Mo is a joke.Performance wise phone is great and gives you  a smooth experience.
"
"
  Amazing Flagship phone by OnePlus. If you have a device to exchange then it is of grat value.
"
"
  This phone is great regarding user experience...coming to camera quality it surely disappoints by adding more brightness compared to the original picture clicked. Hope one plus udpdates that area. Apart from camera every part of this phone is Great!!! Ip68 is also one disadvantageðŸ˜¤
"

  I m using one plus phone first time, Camera quality which I have expected that not upto the mark after using this. Company should be upgrade this and solve this matter.

  Good .. the phone to go without a doubt .. will not regret a bit .  But not many fancy things ..like wireless and reverse wireless. It makes life easy . Can't use a samsung or anyother after using oneplus 8t.

  Amazing phone. Killer performance and display. Great battery life and super fast charging. Great in every aspect of a smartphone, but I still think that camera can be improved and one plus should have provided ip68 rating at this price point.

  Best all rounder phone of 2020 it's my second OnePlus before this I have used 3.5 years OnePlus 5 so I am a long time OnePlus user only drawback this year was camera May be next year they should work on that
"
"
  Performance is very good. If you are looking for good camera then go for iphone 11.Battery draining fast because of 120hz display, We can change the setting to 60hz.Performance is very well, Only bad thing is camera is not upto the mark.
"
"
  I like everything in this phone except te battery life. It's a worth buying.
"
"
  It's all good except camera and battery backup. Battery doesn't last a whole day on full charge.Camera is also a big disappoint.Hope one plus will do some software improvement to enhance battery backup and camera performance.
"
"
  Smooth and Fast. I've been using OnePlus 6T before this and this is so much faster than that. The camera is okay but display and speed make up for it.
"
"
  The issue with sensitivity of the screen while on call is really a pain, not sure why it is not fixed while it was perfectly fine in the previous model
"
"
  In this price segment i think it is the best phone to consider,It handles all task smoothly,the phone feels buttery smooth,also the camera is very decent unless you are seeking to buy a phone with professional camera. I got screen on time of 6~7 hours easily.
"
"
  Heating issues and low battery backup.during normal use phone heats a lot and battery back up is worst.
"
"
  Given the price range and it's amazing set of features, I'd say this an amazing product. If you think OS is an issue for you I'd also say there isn't much of an option apart from this that will make you appreciate the product. OneUI will never cut it for me.
"
"
  I like battery charging too fast and cemera but battery backup within half day 60 to 70 % drying and performance is average not meet my expectations.Price is too high... based on performance.
"
"
  Everything is superb about the phone ....just needed some changes on the camera software side..other than this a good phone in terms of display and battery life considering continuous usage at 120 hz refresh rate..
"
"
  Good flagship phone. Charging to this phone is superb less than 35min takes to full from 10% battery. Allover it's specification is 80% good. Price is high compare to mi 10t. But 8t display and battery gives fight to mi10t.
"
"
  The phones charger, display and battery life are too good. But when u compare the camera with my previous Pixel 2XL it's not that good. Detailing and potrait mode needs improvement. OS is smooth

  Awesome phone but I expect wireless as it was introduced in 8 ProI am using op 6 since 19.07.2018 but even a single issue was not faced by me.No. 8 is lucky for me and 8 T is last phone in that issue number by one plus.
"
"
  Extremely good fast charging and 120hz display is also good with a pretty quickly Snapdragon 865 processor the only thing missing was 8T didn't install the Snapdragon 865+ still it's one of the best android smartphone in the world.

  one won't regret after purchase, I purchased this handset one month back.. , till now its working fine, battery life is great .. more than full day .. gets fully charged in less than 40 minutes with 65w charger.. till now great..

  Trust me, everything is ultra smooth....The only issue for me is its Camera...Dont take it in wrong way...Camera is good, but not justifiable to the Price of 43000...I think as per camera n everything this device is over priced by 5000....

"
"
  This is the worst Product from One Plus and didn't expect this worst overall quality at Rs 46k..
"
"
  I expected a samsung like camera quality but still OnePlus needs to up it's ante and get a premium camera sensor in its flagship killer phone. Rest all no complaints and I liked the previous oxygen os skins better than the latest ones.
"
"
  Battery performance is not at all upto the mark. Camera is also not of flagship range. When we r spending 43k atleast these silly things must be taken care
"
"
  I likes it overall but camera quality may be lil bit better if oneplus wanted it to be otherwise a good buy
"
"
  Using one plus from last 3 days, faced few issues while setting old mbl data to one plus.camera quality is superb and touch mode ðŸ‘Œ,found no lag while using it. Battery life can be increased little. Overall good experience. Can go with it.

"
  I have been using OnePlus for last five years and this 8T has disappointed me a lot.. Very poor camera quality even after the update no changes.. And compare to 6T videos in youtube is not that much visual good in 8T.. Only good is fast charging nd 120hz.
"
"
  Op 8T is the best Andriod phone in 2020..Camera quality is awesome..nightscape view wow!!iam just messmerise...charger is superfast...in 25 min battery is fully charged.Disply is one of the best...During typing iam satisfied.Totally my money is worthful

  Disappointed. Upgraded from OP 5. Battery life average. Won't last a day, thanks to 120hz. Worse than OP5. Should have gone with 8, at least for those aesthetic looks.

  first of all , this is not an camera phone , so dont expect a good camera at this price.other than that , rest all other features are best of class.the oxygen os user experience is the best among android phones

  Finger printer reader is irritating, my oneplus5 had a much better one! Battery life is 20-24 hrs, recharges quickly though. Camera I liked. But in all, its glitchy, tints yellow, hangs... wouldnt recommend for sure.
"
"
  Excellent features in Phone finger print reader excellent camera quality supererb,but one mini disadvantage baterry back up not meet expectations but charging very fast with in 35 mins phone fully charged
"
"
  Must improve the camera quality instead quantity and the worst part is the automatic call recording not supported by it and other third party apps. Speed is quiet good. Must have a curved glass

  One of the best Android phone with latest SD processor. Good camera. Super fast charging from 0 to 100% in just 20min. Amazing features like zen mode, lock screen etc. Good display, premium body design.

  Everything about this phone is excellent except camera and battery drainage... Camera and battery performance good but not extraordinary...
"

  just as i had expected, doesn't lag or hang. Perfect pictures on camera
"
"
  I used OnePlus before but some how this phone has hanged 2-3 times in a week's time of use. This is something not expected out of OnePlus. Other than that, this is AWESOME
"

  Overall review for phone is good.....In this budget range, phone is better in overall performance.The good thing in this is fast charging....which Is really amazing....
"
"
  Smooth. Fast. Great display. Even better camera. Worth the money. SUPERFAST charging.Cons: No wireless charging.
"
"
  Worst phone. Did not expect this From one plus. Very disappointed.Camera quality is major issue
"
"
  All the features amazing except front camera..... overall exceptional
"
"
  Definitely fastest Android mobile due to its smoothest Oxygen OS.Finger print is most accurate unlike samsung devices which struggle to do so. 120hz is buttery smooth.
"
"
  One of the best phones in the market rn.All the features are simply exemplary and it stands out from all the other mobiles in the flagship range.Its even better if you can combine offers and buy the ting!â­â­â­â­â­
"
"
  Phone is butter smooth , I love the mobile after camera updates i am loving mobile soo much. The fast charger charges in max 20 mins which is very helpful for me.but not sure if it may effect battery life .
"
"
  Good Quality and luxury experience
"
"
  Have been using it for last one month and have to say ""It's simply smooth and superb""Loved it so far!!!
"

  Everything about this product is great, except for the camera. If you want a phone with better camera go with Samsung galaxy FE.
"

  Fingerprint fast workBattery life averageCamera quality good
"

  Â Value for money â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸... If confused between iph and OnePlus for gaming n performance basis I would suggest you to go for 8T.. You will love it man...
"

  software issue... Network issue.. call connection issue..  full screen , wifi connection
"
"
  A very well designed phone for a great user experience. I really liked its camera performance. The touch and feel along with the aquamarine green color is suuper cool.
"
"
  @40k range we expect to get more better camera,more powerful battery (ofcourse considering 120 hertz) others wise great phone with oxygen 11 surely flaghip experience.
"
"
  Finger print reader is osm and battery life is great charged it in morning 8 and evening after 6 also I got 60per leftAlthough I'm a heavy user and the 120htz display osm
"
"
  One of the best phone till now I had used many mobile last 6 to 7 yrs but one plus 8t magical it's awesome I have recommend to everybody purchase one plus 8 t for smooth functioning of ur work in mobile.
"
"
  Snappy but buggy Alexa hands free and OTG not working in my case, so far the experience is not as good as 7T. It is not worth upgrading.
"
"
  It lags a lot due to its poor storage management.I have bought it from whole of my pocket but it not worth a little penny .After a month it gets heated a lot while playing games.It feels like cheap mobile.
"
"
  There is no headset inside the package...... People says there is no call recorder options hey guy did you check the calling options clearly if you scroll left side you will find call recorder
"
"
  Even after having 120Hz refresh rate, it doesn't support 90fps gameplay.Also phone's audio and bluetooth has issues.
"
"
  I disappointed with EMI, because I have done transaction with 42753rs, but the merchant has converted to 45000 rs, (7506/ month)this not fair, that to they said no cost of EMI.
"
"
  This is the best ... Super smooth ... Superb battery ... Fab camera.... This device have all things anyone want in a phone. Latest and updated .... U get updates faster and u got really useful updates...
"
"
  Best , Best and Best. Samsung even fails in camera , battery, screen touch smoothness. Well doe One Plus
"
"
  It's good one but there are some bugs to fix I think it will fix after some updates.one thing I want to say it's a beast
"
"
  Very bad camera quality
"
"
  Not recommended at this price,,main drawback heating issue,,phone heats up even during video calls, can't play games also due to heating prb,otherwise touch screen is good..
"
"
  Lovely piece of gadget. As expected of One Plus
"
"
  Battery charging is awesome with 65WDamn good looking with premium lookOverall good in other factors
"
"
  Amazing product.... Crazy performance.... Camera is fine but cud hav been better.... No built in Alexa which is a sad thing... Heating issue during set up but after that nthng yet...
"
"
  One plus 8T was good product and the problem is with parallel what's app I think there was a problem in fixing bugs .Remaining everything was good .
"
"
  Liked all features except for camera as it's an old sensor and doesn't compete with its near competitors
"
"
  Call recording apps cannot be installed..overall unsatisfied when you changed from samsung to oneplus.
"
"
  The phone has good performance though...but if you're looking for a good camera, this isn't the one!
"
"
  Battery life should have been better.
"
"
  Basically, it's a Oneplus Nord with better camera. If you don't game on it, you wont find any difference between the two. The fast charging is not bad, but warp charging is only slower by 15-20 mins.
"
"
  Great battery backup. Phone gets charged super quickly. Fine camera . Grt performance
"
"
  Every thing is perfect but camera is not perfect for its price, please give a update for camera otherwise you will loose customers in heavy way

  All over superb, in macro 8/10.Rear cam. 9/10.Battery. 9/10.Fingerprint. 9/10.and as a oneplus8t customer l want to tell you ples include a oneplus bluetoothheadphone in this package.
"
"
  Awesome phone . It runs buttry smooth but main problem is camera quality. It does not meet the flagship level.
"
"
  It's amazing in 120hz smoothness,I don't see any lacking after heavy usage on three days. The charging unit is remarkably done. Decent camera. Overall happy about the purchase.
"
"
  Product performance is good and battery charging is very fast. Display is very sharp and good. Photos are not bad. Should have wireless charging.
"
"
  Package was broken a big hole..but there is no problem in outer layer plastic which it is covered
"
"
  Awesome Phone .. super charging speed and powerful performance.. cameras are decent enough .. 120hz will drain battery too quickly but warp charge 65w will make things super easy
"
"
  Best in performance.Camera should be best at this range but comparably good.Battery performance is best.Sound quality expected to be Dolby but it is stereo based. Nice
"
"
  I have heating issues with my phone, I am regularly contacting Amazon regarding the same but I am not getting any resolution, and everyone is telling me a different thing when ever I contact them

  Great phone but battery drain issue and heating issueI am 5 day using
"
"
  The camera quality is very disappointing at this price point , very poor camera quality ever one plus 7 pro has a better camera than this phone , in other departments it does the job
"
"
  If u considered value for money than one plus  a better phone ! I have used iphone for long and switching to one plus ! And its satisfying ! Better than iPhone 11 ! Overall
"
"
  I have been using the one plus 3 before I got the one plus 8T. The oxygen OS has improved a lot and lots of handy features and without a doubt I would recommend this phone.
"
"
  Inspite of avg. Battery life ( 6 1/2 hr Screen on time on 120Hz) screen quality and fingerprint sensor is good.Worth buying.
"
"
  The phone bought this on festival season.its working nice. Battery life is good for 1day and camera is decent and it should be little improved.
"
"
  Hardware of phone is excellent but some of bugs in software like call recording issue & message issue while attachment of contract, etc
"
"
  One of the best flagships of 1+ 8 series.Charging speed is unbelievable.Performance out of range.The camera quality is not good as expected.
"
"
  This is my 3rd one plus phone.Clear review that dont buy it...Specifications are only on paper.OnePlus 3t and 7 are better than this.
"

  Top quality camera (best nightmode after update), 19-20 hr (100->20%) battery life (normal uses), using 60Hz phone is also fast and smooth, Full charge less than 45 min.
"

  Same as one plus 8 the main differences are battery and screen

  Fingerprint sensor is quite faster. It unlocks the phone within one second. Battery life is also reliable. Camera quality is good but not as expected.
