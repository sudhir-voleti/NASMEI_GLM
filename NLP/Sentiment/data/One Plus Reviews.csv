"Everything is best except the thing that one plus hasn't provided headphones with handset..n even cleaning cloth is not there...only one transparent cover case is available..phone doesn't have headphones jack n hence it should have provided headphones..mine is mirror Black..

"The same thing happening in the new replaced phone also I feel disappointed it's not worth for the money. It's hanging a lot in phone application. I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...

"Worth every buck.Finally one plus has involved and presented a better shaped handset.- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.- Best in class camera.- Better battery life and charging.

"Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.I ordered it on 16th May 12PM and it got delivered by 17th May 10AMAnd so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. <U+0001F60D>

"No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.

"I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is bad than my oneplus 3.Its not able to focus correctly and the final image is blurry.I discovered the issue when clicking a pic of a document.The text was not sharp and all and after doing some more testing with 3rd party apps , and going thru Oneplus Forum, found that many people are facing this same issue.Oneplus should fix this issue, else this would be like OP 2

"I got the Phone Yesterday. And from my 1 Day experience I'm giving you short review.. I won't go for the things It doesn't have.. I'll tell, how it works with the Things it have..1. Oh Boy, the Display, It's Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome. No Display and I say No Display is Smooth and Vivid as This One...2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855 show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. No way it's A One Handed Device. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! Yesterday at Night 11.30 pm I started Charging with 11% Battery. Within 12.35 am it's 100%. It's Blazing Fast.Now Let's Talk about some Mediocre Stuff-4. Camera! It's Ok I'd say.. Colour is slightly shifted.. I don't know Why but My Poco is Capturing Better image than this in Automatic Mode.. It's Good and like traditional One Plus Camera.. The Only Weakness!! Front Camera is good but nothing Mind-blowing Crazy..  It tends to Crop too much in Front Camera Portrait Shots.I hope One Plus implement Wide Angle Video Recording..All I can say, It's Good Phone for 52K.. Value for Money.. But Market will be Competitive in May with Asus and Redmi New Launch. So if you can, Wait for 1 Month and Compare with Other Things.But If for Display, I will Choose this Phone Anyday over Upcoming Ones.. It's Best.... I think till Samsung Note 10, the One Plus Display will be Champion in Market.I didn't talk about 3.0 UFS storage cause everyday usage you won't see much difference.And Sorry for my Poor English!

"""FLAGSHIP KILLER TO FLAGSHIP""Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here's all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro's DISPLAY looks damn beautiful <U+0001F60D> with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally <U+0001F61B>.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it's little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon <U+0001F61C>Note: I'll update review, after using for few days.

"Very first 30 minutes of using the mobile phone (Unboxed it), It started heating up, temperature went up to 43 Degrees,Battery started draining, GPS didn't pick the location. Later fingerprint sensor was responding... I have to use the phone pin to unblock.Even visited the service center in Banjara Hills, And they told me to recreate the scene, Due to heat I have switch off the device, Fear of It might explode. Later they said to use for another day and visit again. Device still heating up.. same issues, Didn't expect this from a flagship phone with a heavy price....Contacting amazon to return the device

"I have been using this phone for about last 4 days and the best part about this phone is the display it's truly gorgeous once you start using 1440P 90Hz display I bet you won't even feel using the 1080p display and the cherry on the top is its OLED black is black and all the colours looks just so great that it makes viewing experience like you are sitting in a IMAX.Alright enough about the display now speaking about the camera I think over the updates oneplus will improve it but still as of today it's still performs quite well in well lit environment but it underperfoms in low light environment however nightscape mode works quite well but I hope for the oneplus improvvs it over the updates.Under producing selfie camera performs well and I really like that it has a free fall detection which is like and insurance for your phoneSpeaking about the battery if you're going to game then I guess you will get around 4 hours of screen on time on 1440 p at 90 hz but if you are going to use this phone as a daily driver then it can get you through all the day I charge my phone at 7 in the morning and when I came back home at around 12 o'clock at the night I still had around 20% battery left so it's quite good for me.Other Interesting features like the processor of this phone the beauty of this phone and the glass back and its display is just Cherry on the top.In conclusion this is by far the best phone I have ever bought if you are going to buy any phone at around 50k price. Then definitely go for this and I think 8GB RAM variant is good enough I don't know why they made 12 GB variant

"Heating as hell, poor battery backup. Camera is not good. And it's heavy. Don't feel effect of Dolby Atmos.Pro- just it's screen.I will update after further usage.Update after 1 week, heating issue gone. Facing WhatsApp and YouTube application's frequent crash. Camera quality is still an issue, it's good but not up to the mark of flagship.Update- pro-1. fingerprint sensor + face unlock is fast.2. night camera is really good3. video recording is stable.con-1. During calls there is a whistling sound.2. sometimes touch is not working properly in whatsapp,vlc, youtube, asphalt 8 etc.3. selfie camera is not upto mark4. phone is hanging after first update.

"I generally use Apple iphone but this time I tried something different. I completely disappointed by using Oneplus 7 pro camera .iPhone 6 camera is more better than this. OIS and EIS is not working properly. There are so many UI issues as well in Oxygen OS.Phone is quite Bulky and not able to handle by using single hand. I wasted 53k to buy this phone. I never buy any product of OnePlus in future.

"One plus 7 pro is sold at a higher price and the device doesn't justify that, with no headphone jack and a dismal battey life i would suggest to wait for one plus 7. They don't include type - c to 3.5 jack connector in the box. WHEN I SAY THAT BATTERY LIFE IS POOR I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT. you barely get 4 hrs on time with the screen with 90hz, they have included 60hz option in the settings but which fool would change from 90 to 60hz ? the 90hz will spoil you and you will NEVER go back to 60hz screen. As i said the mobile overall is average not bad. They have provided a WARP charger which charges like crazy fast which will somehow 'compensate' a bad battery ?  NO  There were numerous occasions where i had to charge 3-4 times a day of heavy usage. The WARP charger charges the device to 50% in 20 min which is the only reason why i haven't gone for refund, really.As for the camera, it's 'average' for a flagship device. One plus pro are a premium rage smartphones which aims to compete with flagships, it isn't a 'flagship killer' but a 'flagship contender'The photos on bright sunlight and good lighting are good but fally horribly bad on low lighting and night time. So dismal.Some neat features in this device is that it is really smart , the sensors are top notch and detect the phone movement so scarily accurate . For example when you life the device from the table or a bed or whatever the sensors detect the movement and the screen lights up for you to check for notifications, note that this isn't because the front cam detects your 'ugly' face because the front cam is neatly sealed inside the device and it pops up when you need to take a selfie or a face recognition unlock with help of a magnetic motor. The device's screen is good not great i don't understand why there is a huge fuss around it.One more thing i have noted is that the vibrating motor in this device is very top class, they have clearly put a lot of effort in perfecting it, you can set the vibration intensity to match you satisfaction, be careful though if it is too high, when the mobile vibrates you too vibrate along with it :)I , thus conclude by stating that this device is a very 'average' 'smart' phone with a good screen which also happends to be a flagship for one plus company.

"One of the best phones I have used, be it android or iOS.The performance is buttery smooth, compared side by side with a Oneplus 6T, and 90hz display really makes a hell lot of difference.Updated to the 9.5.4 available while writing the review, and the battery life is awesome, getting 6 hrs screen on time with 90hz display. Camera is decent, just put the GCam, and it becomes a versatile camera option to shoot in different scenarios.Warp charging is the highlight and really charges the phone pretty quick, I don't miss my dash charging even with this huge battery.The haptic motor is finally really good, and now typing and other small tasks gives that satisfying vibrations.Stereo speakers are of really good quality and they are loud and clear.As for the headphone jack and adapter, everyone should know that before getting this device, spending <U+20B9>50k for a device without prior research is your mistake. Sure they should have given atleast an adapter, but it's no reason to give this one star.Overall, really awesome device, much better than the exynos galaxy that we get here in India.

"I completely Loved the display quality , sound quality , finger print sensor , Pop up camera, wide angle , 3x zoom and night scape camera. I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others .

"Phone is like a brick. Very heavy. I mean you can't talk without headphones. Interesting thing is one plus calling this premium phone. They have the audacity to give this phone without earphone and any kind of adapter from type c to 3.55. Thats arrogance at it's best. Basically you are stuck and spend whole lot of money for Bluetooth ear phone. Only saving grace of this phone is performance. Ui is not great and very old. Vivo has better ui than this phone. Buy if you want to shell out extra money for simple things like adapter and all.  It is not water resistant too. No it's rating. This is my first and last one plus.

"Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.

"Neither a flagship phone nor a flagship killer. It's an expensive joke..  Mi note 5 pro camera is far far better than this idot box.  48 MP camera is a joke.  The tech reviewers gave biased reviews.

"I didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.

"OnePlus 6T was among the fastest Android ever and this time OnePlus has truly gone beyond speed to make one of the best phones of 2019.Pros-1. Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It's as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It's blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone's tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging. Again, not felt as a con because of warp charging, but still.Conclusion: If you can wait for a while for the camera to be improved and don't mind the above cons, definitely go for it. Nebula Blue is a beauty!

"I've been using the phone for a week now and the only thing I hate about this phone is the camera. Dear OnePlus, please sort out this asap. The camera is not what you expect for the price and the image processing is ""bitter"" this time.Except for that single thing, This phone is the snappiest one yet released in 2019 and they have done no compromise with the display. The 90Hz display is just mind-blowing and I can guarantee you that once you get adjusted to those curved sides of the display, you won't take your eyes off it.Then there are some minor bugs which will be sorted out later on with updates. The phone feels great in the hands even though people claims it to be a bit heavier than other flagships. But I personally love the feel of the phone in my hands, it's just a solid feel. The buttons are placed perfectly in this phone, you won't accidentally hit any buttons on either sides.If you have the money to spend, this is the best choice as of today and if you're preferring the best camera phone in a budhet, go for Pixel 3a and if the price is not a problem for you there are several other phones in the market.Don't worry about the missing ip rating and the fact that this phone doesn't have wireless charging feature, the warp charge doess all justice to you.The fingerprint has improved so much that it's almost as fast as a conventional scanner.Yes, you're going to miss the face unlock feature. It's still there but it's not worth your time.So overall, go get this device after keeping this information in mind.There's one more thing I noticed in another review here in the Amazon page, that a customer saying that he didn't recieve the wireless bullets and two extra cases as seen in many review videos on youtube. Please, those are the review packages that youtubers get to review the phone. The in box contents are clearly given in the description, so please don't underrate the phone due to these reasons.Hope you have a great time enjoying this phone. Just go for it.

"Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung's flagship phones.Pro's :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO's VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It's that fast.CON's :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don't compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during ""conference"" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn't give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn't even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It's a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT's, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS....

"Ordered this on 16th and got it 20th. Don't know why??This phone doesn't have headphone Jacks but it's a Bluetooth one. Oneplus should have provided it but they haven't. But on unboxing vedio which are available shows they provide 2 covers n Bluetooth headset as well. Nothing phadu is available in this phone. If you want then u can opt for something else.Apart from this, phone is almost like 6t but yes no lags at all. Average quality camera, good selfies. Gaming is cool.I like it because it is so smooth but not worth of 52k.

"Got it in a day, and have been using it for a day, till now the experience is quite good, here are the pros and cons I noticed-Pros-1. The display is absolutely amazing 90Hz refresh rate makes everything make more fluid, plus the HDR support is a good feature since they are tying up with Netflix to bring HDR content, although some apps have not used the curves at top and bottom of the screen properly.2. The phone is fast and I mean damn fast, thanks to the Qualcomm SD 855.3. Battery life lasts about a day with medium use, with heavy use with QHD and 90Hz kept on, the battery drains fast. But  with the WRAP30 charger it charges pretty fast.4. The UFS3.0 storage is very fast.5. The phone design looks good, one of the best looking smartphones with a glass back.Cons-1. The biggest con is it has no headphone jack AND no USB-C to 3.5mm converter or USB-C headphone is provided with this, so you have to shell out extra bucks for that.2. The upcoming OnePlus 7 still has SD855 and 48MP processor, although it costs about 32999.3. The camera is nothing unique for a flagship, but still captures good photo even in lowlight.4. No wireless charging.5. No official water proof rating.6. It's very slippery due to the glass back, so if you've tendency of dropping phones definitely get a cover. Although finger smudges are easy to clean on it unlike the Google Pixel.Over all it's great phone and one can go for it.

"Was one of the first people to order on Amazon. Upgraded from OP6 and there is a few things for which I believe upgrading was worth all money. First, the ""fluid amoled"" display with 90hz refresh rate.. I tell you, if you are a gamer, you will never use a 60HZ display again. The new stereo system and the vibrating motors are good. My biggest concern is the curved display which looks nice but prone to damage. Moreover, if you play PUBG and other such games and use claw setup, the edges may be a problem and you'll need quite some time to adjust. Another concern is, I did not receive a splitter or headphone adapter with my box... No one wants to use a 3rd party splitter with this phone because I don't believe there's any available on the market which can handle their wrap charger. The splitter will cost around 400 INR which is OK, but them not including as a part of the box is an indication that one plus is going through a phase of transition from being a customer oriented brand towards an authoritarian like the big players(Samsung, apple etc.) I fear op7 pro is the last phone from them I'll be able to buy :(

"Review after a week of using:Display:It's as good as it gets. Super AMOLED with 90Hz refresh rate. The colours are vivid and contents are crisp, also, with the video enhancement ratio turned on, the contrast ratio is really kicking in. However, you do not get a Samsung or Apple level display but at this price point, this is a steal.Display Rating - 9/10.Sound:Dolby Atmos gives you the stereo sound that OnePlus has promised and it makes you feel immersed in whatever video you're watching or game you're playing with addition to the full screen display. However, it's not the best sound I've heard on a phone, but it's much better than a lot of phones. And also, it doesn't have ""equal"" amplitude of sound coming out of both speakers. The bottom one is more powerful, probably because it's the main speaker for ringtones. Overall, it's a good speaker for normal users, for audiophiles - not so great.Sound rating - 8/10Camera:When I first turned the camera on, my mind was blown, probably because of the cheerleading effect of the high quality AMOLED display, but even so, it put up competition with devices that took photo with Google Camera Mod or even the Google Pixel's camera as well. In some cases it was great, in some it was lacking. Overall, the dynamic range is great but not the best. The colours are more true to life, and in the normal / auto camera mode it offers an image of size 12MP. True 48MP images can be taken with the pro mode, and if you can set your camera up properly, you can take amazing photos of the milky way and stars, so it's a powerful camera. The Ultra-Wide camera needs some work done as the details look washed out on the pictures taken Ultra-Wide angle lens. The telephoto lens does its job well up to 3x zoom, but it does produce a tad bit of noise. And the night mode is especially good, it preserves the highlights and details and also lightens up the shadows during very challenging conditions. Amazing night mode. And as for selfies, yes, it's amazing, offering upto 16MP including the precise edge detection in portrait mode of both the back and front, the cameras are great. The OnePlus 7 Pro offers video recording of upto 4K 60FPS which is great and offers slow mo video of upto 240fps in 720p. However, there was a really annoying little problem, which was shutter lag, that's probably because of the software and I hope OnePlus improves that. Otherwise some pictures might be ruined because of it. Overall the camera is decent, and not the best.Camera Rating: 8/10Fingerprint Scanner: Even though it's an optical image fingerprint sensor in the age of newly invented ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, it's fast. Not as much as the physical ones but it's definitely the fastest optical fingerprint sensor I've ever used. And the animation looks cool.Fingerprint scanner rating: 9/10UI: OxygenOS is the best UI you can get from a company. It is definitely smooth, fast and easy to use and doesn't look like a bootleg Android and at least it doesn't annoy people with bloatwares and advertisements in the utility apps. It has a lot of features and is highly customizable.UI Rating: 10/10Build: As much sexy as it looks, the OnePlus 7 Pro is fragile if it falls from your hands. Although glass looks premium and feels premium, I'd rather prefer a metal aluminium body. However, with the addition of curved display, a mechanical camera and the glass back, I'm in love with the design. It is definitely one of it's major selling points. The only other con is the lack of headphone jack, but it would have been consider if OnePlus would have at least included a pair of type-C headphones or at least a type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack converter. Keep up the good work, OnePlus!Build rating: 8/10Hardware: The OnePlus 7 Pro rocks a Snapdragon 855 chipset with Adreno 640, and everything you run on this device from games to Antutu 3D benchmarks, everything runs as smooth as butter with no fps drop or stuttering whatsoever, and doesn't heat up very much as well. However it still doesn't surpass a lot of phones if you match the scores.Hardware rating: 9/10In the Box content: In the box you get a 30W Warp Charge supported charging block with cool red type C cable to charge your phone, a flexible rubber case which is a good addition, some papers with a letter from Pete Lau but unfortunately not type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter or type-C headphones. Huge disappointment.In the Box contents rating: 7/10So overall, we can conclude the OnePlus 7 Pro is a fantastic device but the price could have been at least 3K INR less, even after considering the lack of headphones or the converter, and to retain its title of ""Flagship Killer"". Unfortunately, OnePlus has lost it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10

"Okay, so I will get straight to the pros and cons of this phone. I upgraded from 6T and let me share how well it stood up to my expectations in almost every aspect. My review will contain overall and a camparison with 6T.Pros1. Best display ever in a smartphone no doubt. 90hzQuad HD+ display seriously spoila you to an extent that you no longer wish to go back to 60hz.2. Build quality is purely flagship. It looks way beautiful than one plus 6T and it does feels super premium.3. Stereo speakers are a game changer. Loud and crisp noise as compared to one plus 6T and is definitely a demanding feature in a flagship.4. 30 watt WARP charge is a cherry on top. I had no complaint with Dash charge and it makes my experience even more better with Warp charge.5. Camera is very good as compared to one plus 6T and trust me, it won't let you down. Camera on 6T was just a crap.6. You don't have to even consider about performance as you know what one plus is famous for.7. I love the new vibration Moto and heptic feedback.Cons1. Battery backup is fine. For me it last for a day but considering the display, yes it may not perform well up to expectations of some people but trust me it's absolutely fine for a normal day usage.P.S. : for some peoywho are complaining that display color is not good as compared to s10+. Here is one suggestion guys. Just go to settings and adjust the display colors to AMOLED wide gamut. I can assure that the color accuracy will be exactly the same as that of s10+. I compared them side by side and found them exactly the same.Thanks and have a nice time with your One Plus 7 pro

"I was an apple fanboy since 2007. I had used every iPhone that got released in the market till iPhone X (not iPhone XS).  Since I got bored with the same OS for so many number of years, one fine day I decided to try android (keeping aside my ethical reservations about it, since it was an stolen OS as per late Steve Jobs)  and bought an Android AMOLED Phone (to test whether I can thrive on android eco system) which had an on screen finger print scanner.  Strangely, I started liking that android phone  since it had an iOS feel and used it for more  than 6 months.By then I was quite confident that I can rely on an android phone without any regrets and started looking for a flagship phone that can match to iPhone, in terms of Overall User Experience. While Galaxy S10 was one of the obvious choice, I was some how not happy with it(may be due to Apple Vs Samsung Long term dispute) , but  then  the OPP7 got released. :-)I waited and bought 12GB RAM+256GB Storage Phone on Amazon. Before I bought this phone I had read through many reviews online and got really worried about issues posted about this phone,  like ghost display, Mediocre Camera, bad call quality etc etc. Also many reviews for this phone on the  Amazon ltself was not good.  Still I stuck to my decision of buying this phone and let me tell you that I am extremely proud of my decision.Once I got this phone then it simply turned out to be an outstanding phone and completely changed my perceptions about stock android experience. Now I would want to say that it is one of the best phones in the market. While there are many good features as well few shortfalls on this phone,  end of the day the overall user experience is something that I liked utmost.My key take aways about the phone are- I am awestruck with the edge to edge, QHD AMOLED Display with 90 Hz refresh rates and the curved display. You can view everything at  best on this phone.- 12 Gigs RAM keeps the phone blazing fast on all the games I downloaded, of course Snapdragon 855 is an extremely efficient CPU.- Camera: While this was one of the concerns reported utmost by all in the reviews, with the latest software update I would want to say that I could make great photographs with both  48 pixel normal camera as well as with the pop-up Front facing camera. I simply loved the pictures I took on this phone and I am quite confident that it matches to the quality of iPXs Max even at the low light conditions (ensure for latest software updates). The 4k Video captures are great delight.- Warp charge: Can't belive that it took less than hour to charge my phone from less than 5 to 100 %. I have to say Kudos.- Oxygen OS: Simply minimalistic, yet very beautiful. One Plus team has paid every attention to the detail in building this OS. All my need for using a Gesture based OS is completely taken care.- Speakers: Great Stereo speaker alignment with Dolby Atmos experience. While it sounds great, I would want to say that it is not the best audio experience. However there are no regrets.- Build Quality: Overall build quality is absolute wonderful. I loved that buttery touch whether on the screen or on the back.- Weight: That 206 gm of weight in the hand made me to feel that it is a worthy and reliable phone and not just another one of the bunch in the market.- Pre-applied screen guard: Very Happy about it. At least it is not tamper prone out of box. Same logic for the free case that ensures that my device is safe, atleast initially.- Size: While I have seen many complaints about the giagantic size of this phone, my take on it is that it is simply fine. After all for the greater user experience we do need a good screen size phone.- Notifications: Let me tell you that I am extremely particular about the efficiency of notifications from SMS and Whatsapp messages. While my earlier android phone is not efficient as iPhone in this aspect, OP7P had ensured this to me. Very greatful!!Area of Improvements- Battery life: Unless we are concious about managing battery life, it may not lost long especially with the 90 Hz screen refresh rates- No Wireless Charging: Personally I damn care about it. I never used that feature in my iPhone X. But still a drawback.- No Headphone: Exactly same as above. Something not worry much with many bluetooth headphone options. I have paired my Airpod and it works simply great.- No IP Rating: I am very much sure that this phone is splash resistant as well  water resistant for minimal time and I am extremely happy with it. After all I am not a professional swimmer with the intent to use this phone underwater. (with all due respect to the swimmmers)Few aspects about my purchase from Amazon:- Concept of guaranteed price for phones from Amazon was very useful for me. I exchanged my recently bought first android phone and got a good value for exchange- Interest free EMI and discount on my SBI card made me to feel happy- Almost same day delivery of the phone. What else I can ask for.Finally I would want to say that I am not paid by any one (especially by OPO) to write this review but it is an honest user experience by a tech enthusiast.  Still, for any questions, please feel free to write a reply to this post and I will try to respond it asap.

"This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I've seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn't always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I've noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I'm pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I'm very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I'm more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I've heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I'm hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I'm finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own.

"Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.

"Loved itI liked everything in this mobileIt is smooth, fast, powerfulThe latest Oxygen OS.ALL ARE SUPERI liked very much is it's PREMIUM DISPLAY.....You feel yourself as superior.1+ is a brand that no one can beat or at least touch.Some rival companies are saying that flagship killer is coming but I would say you can never beat a Oxygen OS......If you are affordable for this just blindly go for the pro .......Even if you feel it as expensive, gather money & definitely go for this.There are some minor quality issues with cameraBut surely by the time you read this review 1+ would have definitely posted an update and fixed those small things<U+0001F642>.........Never compare 1+ with other brands they are not even worth to sit beside 1+.........You definitely get these thoughts like me after having this phone in your hands............Feel free to ask your queries .......

"One plus 7 pro is an awesome phone no doubts.I am a very strong Apple fan, still i used 99% apple products.I have iphone too, but openly say compare to one plus 7 pro, i phone is nothing.Superb camera,superb perfomance.8 gb ram and 256 gb storage capacity around 52, 000/-.Both front and back cameras are awesome.Good phone for gaming people also.Good wide display.Good sound quality.Superb design.No doubts this is best phone in market now.One plus have good brand name too.What I dislike is 1.) Little over weight. 2.)Battery life not that much better.(One day average)3)No headphone Jacket or head phone with this phone.All other features are superb, inbuilt call record, app lock etc etc.

"I just upgraded from OnePlus 5tDisplay- the best display on any smartphone!I saw the good reviews on this mobile's display but damn! I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...

"I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That's probably the first thing you'll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There's a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don't expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don't need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS' clean interface. It is the fastest device I've ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You'll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I've ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S. Personal review!

"Fastest Android phone on Earth!Samsung, Redmi, Apple, etc etc... Beware guys!Superb Amazon delivery services.Pros1. Lightening speed2. Good battery backup, moreover least charging time 50% in less than 25 minutes3. Good camera, specially nightmode and normal 4k videos4. Wide amoled screen, superb screen refresh rate, it's becomes a pleasure to watch videos using every mm of the screen since it is notchless5. Oxygen os is just awesome.6. Price - I cannot just praise a phone with these many features and then cry for high price. It is still way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy flagship phonesCons1. Camera in portrait mode isn't that sharp.2. I am not exactly aware of how the liquid cooling system works. Phone got hot a couple of times. But bearable heating.3. The curved screen isn't of any use. So no idea why OP has done this. Though the phone looks premium with it.4. No 3.5 jack. The only genuine complaint I have. I tried hard to find a good quality type c-3.5 mm connector. Otherwise one will always rely on Bluetooth headphones.Overall, a phone worthy of praise and purchase.

"I felt bad only on one thing regarding the delivery of the product..I ordered the product on 16th May in early sale for prime members and it was supposed to be deliver on next day 17th May 2019 before 9 pm. But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant

"I'm using this phone since past 3 days. So, here goes:1. Great display. The curved edges and no-notch display is a great head turner. The large screen makes browsing a great experience.2. Smooth UI. No bloatware whatsoever. No nagging notifications. Very smooth and highly customizable UI.3. Decent Camera. I am not much of a shutterbug. But the snaps I clicked were fantastic. Maybe photography enthusiasts will be able to give a better review on this aspect.4. Nice battery life. Easily lasted 1 and a half day with full charge. And the warp charge is a beaut.5. A little heavy. But we can get used to it.

"Dear Mr Bezos,I am writing this in grief that the product which I received is malfunction and I tried to return this product on day 2 of me buying it , but as per your amazon policy money was not refundable . Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic.

"Point1.Fast and buttery smoot- its so fast and smooth that you can hardly tell its opening the simple application or resuming it from ram.2.Display - 90hz display with FHD+ resolution will spoil you, it will literally make u swipe up n down without any reason.3.Speaker - Good stereo speakers will enhance your media consumption experience.4.Battery - Getting good battery life , on an avg 7 hrs SOT with gaming abt 3hrs.5.Weight n size - Size doesn't bother me n yeah its lil heavy however i guess i ll get use to it.- one downside it that if u drop it prone to break due to its heavness.6.IP rating - Not n issue, its tested by manu YouTuber ,i.e it can survive lil water and anyway no company gives you warranty against water damage.7.WI-fi - Geting the speed ISP provide. So no issue.8. Wireless charging - Fast charging is enough.9.Camera - Decent not as good as pixel. Can improve with gcam .This is the area one plus needs to improve.10.No headphone jack- really missing that , i hv Bluetooth earphone but in gameplay u need wired headset or else it gt lilbit delay via Bluetooth so bought a dongle n getting use to it.11.Anything extra will incurred the cost also so at this price point all acceptable.All points are mentioned are according to personal my experience n views.

"I have been using this phone for last 2 days and must say that it is the beast (not just best) among the premium phones.The speed with which the page opens with your fingerprint and apps switches happen, the clarity and quality of the videos and the ultra loud but crystal clear speaker sound can beat many phones of better range any day. You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67"" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.So for a new phone I rate it 5. Let's see & review it's performance after 3-4 months into use

"Time for a 7 pro review, I have used for 14 days now, so after using this giving review. Let me tell you one plus 7 pro is the worlds first fastest phone. 7 pro gives you premium feel, display is unbeatable, look wise this is the most beautiful, sexiest beast till date. There are many Indian you tuber spreading negative reviews of this phone but I tell you if you really wanna decide by review then watch out side Indian you tuber videoes. Yes price of this on high side as compared to oppo Reno, redmi k20 pro but you have to decide if you want to save extra 6k to 8k or you want a premium feel of a smartphone. If yes this phone is for you, if you really want to save money then you can go for 6gb variant also comes with same features, but nebula blue is still sexiest colour. Camera is also damm good, battery life is also good, performance is best. I was one plus 5t user before having this phone so performance wise one plus is best, just go for 7 pro rather than oppo Reno or redmi k20 pro, I bet you 7 pro is the worth buy. You won't regret after buying this beast. This is the world's first fastest, sexiest phone. Just go for it....

"For one I really do like the phone...coming to details the fingerprint reader is a tiny bit slow...but it has numerous unlocking options that work simultaneously...facelock is good...zone / location based is a good feature(though it's not new) overall fingerprint does not make that much an impact.Speed is good.For screen it's very good but for a gamer the buttons on the boundaries do make it a bit difficult to operate but once you get used to it it's ok.Rear camera is very good can't say it's excellent. Front camera should have had more resolution and lighting option.Battery is good for a workhorse like this if you are a gamer expect 40% remaining battery by 3 pm. But the charger is way damn good in 20 min you are back to 90%...Headphones should have been provided, but I use wireless anyways...Tempered Screen protector should have come preapplied instead of the plastic one. mine is developing wrinkles because of gaming...OnePlus phones offer lots of customisation option if one needs and knows how....have seen lots of people not using customisation at all.Overall it's a good phone and a welcome change.

"No doubt regarding the phone's performance. However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these!

"It's worth the price. Yeah camera performance should be improved. Battery life for 90 Hertz refresh rate is not bad. Fingerprint sensor is faster than 6T.What I observed from people rating is they are disappointed because OnePlus didn't include type-c to 3.5mm cable and earphones because of high price.I think because of customers disappointment rating going down. OnePlus should think on it and should get back customers satisfaction.Overall phone performance will never disappoint you. Should include basic accessories to satisfy the customers.

Maybe I got a defected piece . They even refused for a replacement. All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.

"Awesome product. Bought it despite of all criticism. Happy with my decision. When you are a tough competitor than people starts hating you, that's common. Display and performance are the benchmarks. Camera too is doing well with the latest updates, that's what i love most about the OnePlus, they listen to their community and keep you updated from all bugs. It's not light weight so if you are a skinny guy then forget about it or else go for it. Best phone under 50k. If you found it helpful then no need to smash the like button, you just go for this beast. Peace out

"Writing this review after completely understanding this masterpiece. Transforming from IOs to Android was a cakewalk for me thanks to my OnePlus 3T. Even today after almost 3 years of its use I saw no lag issues, no issues with the battery and instant rapid charging which was the really the most important plus point for me.This Version of OnePlus is surely a masterpiece. Be it the speed, the battery backup, rapid WARP charging, Be it the huge screen and yes the premium look makes it a worth buy. It's been 2 days I own it and everyone who looks at it is amazed to see how perfectly everything is compiled to make this masterpiece. The camera is amazing with three modes as described during the launch with an amazing picture quality.  The music with stereo sound and Dolby Atmos  makes it so much full of life..  The only Cons you can find with this device is the absence of Water resistant label. Rest it is BEYOND PERFECTION.

"Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.

"My 3rd OnePlus and had a bit of additional hope from this model. Though not completely disappointed below are few observations after using this phone for few days.1. Too heavy for a phone compared with the other similar or near similar models.2. For some reason I don't see the battery is a winner.3. I do not play games. But apps like Amazon, Flipkart and few others have few seconds lag while opening it. So not sure if it is my phone or all have this issue.4. Camera is OK compared to other similar models available5. Instances of heating while browsing for a bit long. Clueless why5. Wrap charger and Dash Charger. Don't see any major difference. May be some technically, but as an user I personally don't see any huge difference.Finally the best thing happened is with mobile signal. It has improved a lot and I am happy that as a phone 7pro is doing a great job.

"#Stunned #Awesome# Super thrilledApril 2014.. The One plus silently entered the market and making a small ripples ..No one ever expected that it sweeps as Tsunami. I still remember the day when I bought the One Plus One. Happily showing to people about the greatest product . Sadly at that time no one aware about the phone but now we all know who is the real beastSlowly and steadily the brand was reaching all over .The word The Flagship Killer literally killing the people all over. No one ever expected that it will capture the market just like that.From One plus we had more market players all were trying to reach the level of One Plus sadly the truth no one reached to it and still it holds the position.After One Plus one I was like missing the opportunity of moving to the next phone.. But my One Plus one was scoring so good so I didnt feel for the next one..Time moves.. Used other products so called copycat of the Flag Ship Killer phones none were like my One Plus one. Something or other was missing.Now I dont want to lose the opportunity so I banged on the first day and booked the  The Real Flagship Killer One Plus 7 Pro 8GB 256 storage.Now my Beast in Power on Mode and will Unleash soon Will come back soon with my next review of Pictures and Performance and all ..

This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringingCalled up one plus service centre the answer that I got was this would get resolve when there would be a software update but by that time your camera could get affected

Outdoor photo quality is almost at par but indoor photo lacks refinement.Better to try Google cam mod.Software updates will improve camera quality soon.Screen curve is not in comparison with Samsung S10+ ( samsung screen is much sleeker and with better asthetics)Phone is bit bulky not as sleek as previous one plus modelsDefault phone case is not so good, better to buy a new one

"It's a oneplus phone and it gives more than what it has promised. The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze. I faced no issues and was able to get the phone I wanted in record time. It's just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it's already set up and working as usual.

"This is by far the best Oneplus device to be launched till date. I never had a oneplus device before. After using it for a week I came across these observations :Battery life is superb, and warp charge really packs a punch. Does 45% charge in around 15-18 minutes.Fingerprint reader is lightning fast.Rear cameras will make you forget Dslr. Low light photographers can will find this amazing. Front camera is perfect. The device is a little heavy but flaws are less when compared to other advantages. 90hz refresh rate is a boon. Actually you have to get a hands on experience as words will fall short for this beast. There is no question of lag. PUBG and other games are smooth and well the graphics is on another level with the gaming mode setting. The fluid AMOLED screen is pure joy. There is no audio jack but that's wierd  but if you can shell out 50k for a premium device then you can afford to shell out few extra bucks for a Bluetooth headset. Still going through the device features as everyday I am coming across new features which is really cool. Mirror grey looks better those who can't buy the nebula blue, go for mirror grey, you won't be disappointed.Overall the device is a beast. Go for it.

"Amazon's blazzing fast one day delivery of a super blazing fast handset.I am in love with how this device handles every action I demand from it, and this device is worth of every penny.Have not seen such SMOOTH device, also it handles every tough processing games and performs so smooth in every aspect.Camera might not be so great but it's not too bad.Was worried about battery life as heard from other reviews, but it lasts decently long through the day, even after few hours of gaming. And that id not an issue too because there is a 30W warp charge support, which charges rapid Very Rapid.Overall this device justifies the price, as it gives smooth experience as Apple products give which costs way more.Have been a fan of ONEPLUS and finally I have their best device.

"Update after two weeks usage: Can't imagine life without this phone! I am now thoroughly familiar with its functions, and we get along well. The battery has stabilised, and I get 25 to 30 hours easily with around 9 hours on screen. The phone lights up on its perimeter when in lock mode and you get a notification - different colours for different apps. I have given it full marks now as it has surpassed my expectations. I thoroughly recommend this phone and consider it to be great value for money! Please hit like if you found my review helpful and let me know in the comments your experience with this phone.___This is a preliminary review after one day's usage and exploration. It will tell you how I feel about the phone and how I perceive it when comparing it with other phones I have owned. Please remember that every person is looking for different things in a mobile phone so your user experience will be different from mine.My wishlist included honest photography and videography with a clear yet deep sound, long battery life and a front fingerprint reader. I take lots of pictures and hate the overexposed, oversaturated and beautified images that have taken over the market, hence the need for honesty. I had a few phones in mind and kept watching videos trying to figure out which one would suit me best before ordering the One+ 7 Pro. The reason? The photo tests came really close to those of Google Pixel 3 and sometimes surpassed them!So here are some observations I noted down as I got to grips with my new phone:Comes with silicone case but no earphones or adaptor. Guess they expect us to have leftover earphones and adaptors from previous phones?It's large and heavy! Consequently, it gets cumbersome and causes muscle fatigue after a while (had a similar problem with Sony XZ3). I preferred the feel of the Mate 20 Pro as it was slightly slimmer and fitted better and also it was beautifully balanced, so you did not need to exert yourself to hold it. [My hand has gotten used to its weight, but I still feel a bit intimidated by its size and wonder whether we do indeed need such big screens. However, watching Netflix in bed demonstrated the beauty of its large display and the clarity of its sound.]The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Facial recognition is also speedy, but as it requires the recessed camera to work, I am not too keen on using it.Photographs were a bit noisy on portraits but looked artistic. The update fixed the noise issue BUT ruined the portrait mode that is now overexposed. Not sure why; still figuring it out. Need to test it further. The rear camera produced good photographs compared to the Mate 20 Pro, which was a fail. The S7 has more depth of colour, and a nice background separation which gives photos a 3D appearance, something the Mate lacked and the 7 Pro cannot quite achieve. (The S7 was a dynamite phone despite the skin smoothing.) [It was my stupidity. I thought like a Galaxy S7 user that if I click on the face of the person, I'd get an AF lock, but this phone has no AF lock. What it does when you click on the part of the screen is giving you the option to adjust the exposure (light or dark), so I ended up with a washed-out picture - my fault entirely! Also, in portrait mode, it has a little oblong shape that says Depth Effect. This is what controls the bokeh, and you can't do much about it other than make sure it lights up green before snapping the shot. It will light up green only when the camera is at the correct distance from the person. I suppose this is one way of making sure the subject is in proper focus. Talking of the bokeh effect, it is very subtle, unlike other phones. If you want stronger effects, photo manipulation programmes are your friend, but for me, this is good enough.]Videos on the One+ 7 Pro are beautifully stable when walking, but if you turn fast, the image blurs momentarily before it recovers. [I enjoyed using slow motion but not sure if other phones can switch to slow motion during videoing or if the YouTuber vloggers actually splice videos up to add the slow motion part. My phone can take either or videos. The slow-motion does not activate randomly as in the Samsung phones, and I think that gives you more control but, to be honest, I am still a rookie in these things.]Sound playback is excellent in music and films due to the top and bottom speakers, but the microphone can hardly pick up someone talking 1.5 meters away from you in a quiet room when you are taking a video.The display is not as great as any of the comparison phones. The icons (phone, texts, camera, etc.) are not as beautiful as the competition's. There is a poor selection of wallpapers and none of the themes. One thing I enjoyed about the Mate 20 Pro was its wide selection of wallpapers, some of which were animated. Felt so excited to hold a phone that had falling cherry blossoms. Luckily, the Play Store has a variety of free wallpapers and was able to find some that give me joy. [Once a great wallpaper was in situ, everything looked much better!]The curved edge makes the letters from some apps seem to slide downhill, reminds me of Salvador Dali's famous melting paintings. Not a deal-breaker but distracting. App developers and One+ should take that into consideration and condense their displays to leave a black gap on the edges when text is involved. [My brain learned to ignore it.]The bottom navigation bar lies behind ads in games like Solitaire - takes some skill to NOT click on the ad trying to get to the home screen, and I am proud that I have mastered it. [Should not be a problem if you are not using the silicon case. If you do have the case on as I do, learn to start the scrolling action from the silicon itself, and you won't miss.]Angry Birds Friends is not loading and constantly crashing. [Uninstalled the app as per Rovio's instructions and re-installed it. It worked until I exited. Then I was again unable to load it. This morning, it works again. Mystery!]Bejewelled Blitz was jumpy despite the 90 Hz refresh rate, and it feels laggy. Taking off the Fnatic mode seemed to improve things a bit (though Fnatic is meant to be ideal for gaming...) [Checked this morning, still laggy at 60 Hz even if all other games are closed. I can understand the screen being slow because of the screen protector causing more friction, but why is the game slow to load results? Maybe my broadband is slow at times?]Colours on apps seem dirty instead of bright and vibrant as in comparison phones. Also, blacks look greyed out. [I got used to the new look of colours, and it does not bother me any more. I have even reduced the display settings to save battery as that is more important to me at the moment.]Google Calendar is more laborious to work with than the Samsung calendar as it requires to select what kind of entry you are entering - ugh! (Ease off, Google. Just let me enter it and trust me to know what my entry is for!!)Step counter kept counting up despite me not taking a single step. It just felt the vibrations of me picking the phone up and thought this was walking. Hmm... to cheat or not to cheat? [I don't really fancy walking around with this big phone, so I have left my old phone in the bathroom LOL]I did not use the file transfer app they recommend as I had a bad experience with Huawei's own and never said again. Sadly restoring from Google backup, did not restore my text messages. The other phones did, which is baffling. [Apparently, Google security does not allow a full restore unless you verify it is you who logged in from a new device, so do that first and then try the restore.]The keyboard is more accurate than the Samsung one, probably due to space, but it makes it more tedious to type as you need to move your finger further. However, it has a great feature: a proper keypad that can be activated entering a series of numbers. On the minus side, the special characters are slightly harder to get to.The final observation is that the battery seems to drain fast (very steep slope in the diagram). The battery charges fully in 1 hour 20', and despite predictions that the phone would only last till 3 am, the phone survived the night on standby mode till 6 am. Although the screen was on for about 6 hours yesterday, I didn't do much other than set it up, take a few pics and a couple of short videos and try out my game apps. The Mate 20 Pro had an amazing battery life. [The battery continues to worry me. If I need to be charging it more than once a day, then I have gained nothing over my old phone. I have now put the phone on a dark theme, reduced the Hz from 90 to 60 and lowered the resolution. I also make a point to close every app when I am not using it. I am now confident enough to say that if there is a deal-breaker for me, it will be battery life; however, apart from the 6T, most phones have worse battery life. The Mate 20 has a great battery, but the photography is ... ugh! I will try to let the battery drain and then charge it early morning and see how it fares. With light use, I would have expected the battery to last more than 23 hours :( Imagine if I start using it exclusively as I did with my S7!]Conclusion: I am not 100% convinced this phone is for me though I can learn to live with it. I know from reviews that the One+ 6T has much better battery life and photography so maybe that would be an option...? [I am so tempted to order it and compare!!!]I have just uploaded a screenshot of the battery information. It has improved. The phone goes into panic mode at 15%, but if you ignore its message, it will see you through the night on standby and give you a couple of hours light use before it truly needs recharging.

"Friends ordered this phone and received in just 2 days time. Very much happy with the purchase. Heard a lot of negative complaints like camera, phantom touch, slow fingerprint etc. Which phone haven't has that. But this one really lived up to my expectations. The issues with this phone will definitely go away with updates, I received the first update and there is development in camera quality. I haven't had any experience of phantom touch and poor fingerprint yet. The display is very punchy and accurate. OnePlus development team is very active and will provide all updates to optimise this phone..so go for it.

"Bought on the first day and received in the same night in around 7hrs. Classy looks, excellent buttery smooth display and flawless performance.A bit underwhelmed by the camera performance till now. Sometimes the pictures are good sometimes are over beautified and smooth, needs retouching afterwords. But yet to test outdoors in depth.Photos attached are retouched a little.Battery seems to last a day with moderate use and occasional gaming.Phone is slightly heavier than expected or desired.Definitely worth an upgrade from 3T if you want a great display and performance.6-128 version will suffice the need of moderate users..

"One plus put a lot of effort while designing the phone itself it's a beautiful peice of technology. Feels premium! The screen is just irresistible it's just wow. With QuadHD panel with 90hz refresh rate it's the best in the market now. One plus did well with the cameras this time. The main sensor the 48MP one is good after the update. But the wide angle suffers a bit in low light plus 3x zoom lens performance lies between the main sensor and wide angle. The portrait comes great out of the device. The selfie cam is good but seems to get harder on face in WhatsApp cam. The battery backup is okay considering the fact the phone has qhd screen with 90hz refresh rate. Yes we can change that for sure. The haptic feedback is just wow much better that previous models. The finger print reader is fast sometimes inaccurate but yes it's good. Oxygen OS doesn't need any explanation it's just buttery smooth. Thanks to the SD 855 and 8GB ram on my phone plus the UFS 3.0 storage throw any app on the device it will hadle it without a sweat multitasking is top notch on this set. But seriously one plus just had me on the screen and design....!

"First ever I purchased 1+ series and this is the worst phone after spending 50k on it... My suggestion not ever buy any 1+ phone..... After 10-12 days your phone will start hang and there is glitch in there phone..... When u try to use use your phone after 15-20 minutes and unlock ur phone this phone will.give u surprise and all of the icons will.dissapear because of glitch and no keyboard nothing and then after that u need to lock it and unlock it again so that it will work after wait 20 minutes it will happen again. Best part is amazon as always cant help you in this because becauae they are full of dumb associates in the organisation. If we talk about 1+ there chat support is of no use like there phone they give u stupid steps to troublshoot and after that sent u at store and they do same and sent u back

"Really an amazing phone.You will fall for the screen itself.Bought on amazon prime sale on 16th and got it on 17th. Super fast delivery by amazon. kudos.Coming it the phone, it came with the pre-applied screen protector and a transparent case. That's a good welcome gesture. This is my first OnePlus phone coming from a stock android phone. The OOS is clutter free and experience is pure smooth with 90Hz and QHD+ resolution. With that in mind, the SOT of the phone with full brightness will  hardly reach 5 Hours. I use this preset in home as, thanks to warp charge, which charges in 1 Hr 10 min from 0 %. And when I go to office or any other, I use the FHD+ and 60Hz preset to get almost ~8 hours SOT with medium to high brightness.Basically this is a gaming phone. So you can play PUBG with no lag at all, also maxed out settings in Call of Duty Mobile.Camera quality is very promising. I used Gcam to get almost as good as pixel like shots. Day light shots in stock cam is better than GCam. Except for the consistency across the cameras. I hope OP will fix this issue with an update.Finally I would say that, this mobile is totally worth it for the price you pay.

"My previously used few mobiles - Galaxy S7,S8,Note 8,Note 9....This time i have decided to go with one plus for first time, and belive me,it was a fantastic decesion.Previously i am avoiding other mobile brands ,only for displays.But this time one plus hitted a bulls-eye.Thanks to great display.I am amongst first few members to buy this master piece,as soon as it has launched and i have taken full 20 days to evaluate this mobile to write this review.As promised,delivery of mobile was superquick by Amazon.I have received this mobile,even before it was released for regular customers,and available on retail outlets.Thanks to Amazon.This mobile is overall a very good package. Display of this mobile is fantastic,with crisp and clear pictures.Though samsung displays are little bit superior,but margin is very narrow and for day today work,margin is absolutely nil.This displays donot oversaturate the images and pictures.Battery life is fantastic and last for entire day easily with heavy use on 60 hz QHD setting.On 90 hz it is little less.Battery life is definately far far better compaired to my Note 9.Camera quality needs some improvements, but i am sure that one plus will definately rectify it in upcoming updates.Already,a update from one plus has improved camera performance drastically.Mobile is little overweight and big to handle for average sized hand people,but it is matter of just getting ""used to it"".Once you get used to it,you will definately enjoy using this mobile and watching movies on it.Sound quality is crispy clear and battery backup is also very good,even if you use blutooth headsets.Fingerprint reader is fast but still needs some improvement...SD 855 Processor is superfast.No need to review it,as this is fastest amongst all mobiles,i have used in past.UI is very good,and you can adjust it according to your needs.WRAP charging is fantastic.You will get decent battery charge within 15 min of charging this mobile in emergency situations,though it will not be required in day today practice,as battery backup is fantastic for mod-heavy users,as stated earlier.I my opinion,compairing price to performance ratio,this moble is the best mobile to buy to date.So ""JUST GO FOR IT"".Now ,I became a proud fan of one plus.

It's really a big phone. If you are using big phone even though you feel it's bigger. Screen is curved and glass body looks cool. Op7 pro comes with inbuilt fingerprint reader and it's quite fast. I have also taken many pictures and all the photos are just perfect. I have also played pubg and it's run really pretty well. But I am still waiting for the day when one plus roll out update so we can also played pubg @ 90 FPS. Battery life is good. Only thing I missed is 3.5 mm Jack for headphones. Other than that all the things really cool and perfect.<U+0001F44C> I must say if you are a heavy mobile user, or if you want to use a best Android phone or if you love to play game than this phone is for you.

"'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it's great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it's not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung's edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it's performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it's the imperative reason of it's existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it's just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won't let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn't found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend's shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung's done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don't feel it's a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won't miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it's leagues ahead not just from it's own siblings but with most of the competitions as well.

"I have been using this phone from more than a week now. Here are the things I liked and disliked:# Display is Great (but its glamour goes away after putting on a back cover, which is necessary as the phone is too slippery without it <U+0001F641>)# Camera is not that great if we see it from the price point. I was using OnePlus 5T before this and i feel i had a better camera setup. Also, I don't know why nobody is talking about the Portrait mode of the rear camera, it automatically zooms the image 3x, making it hard to take portraits of a nearby people/objects. Also, zooming 3x makes things very shaky and hard to take a steady shot. Really not satisfied with the Portrait mode's auto cropping zoom. Similar issue was there in OnePlus 5, the first OP phone having a dual camera setup, but the issue was resolved in 5T.# The next big thing that no one is talking about in the reviews is unavailability of Notification LED. This is seriously a big turn off for me.# Battery backup is decent considering the screen size and display quality.# The phone is too slippery without a cover. The phone attracts a lot of dirt and is also a fingerprint magnet.# The company should have provided a better back cover and Type C earphones (or at-least the Type C to 3.5mm jack converter) within the box at this price.# I also purchased the OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 separately. Their sound quality it's good but there is no sound feedback received (the connecting beep sound that you get after long pressing the button) while using Google Assistant via the button on wireless bullets. Even my wired earphones provide that feature.Overall its a good phone if camera is not a great deal for you. Though the OnePlus should have kept the starting price of this phone under 40k. Instead of wasting money on advertisement and making big celebrities their brand ambassadors, the company should stick to their original vision of providing flagship killer features at an even killer Price tag.

"I received a new OnePlus 7 Pro just yesterday, and when I tried to add both my sim cards in it, I found out the second sim slot was too small to add even a nano SIM card.After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.What kind of pathetic service is this?!This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.OnePlus's call centers are also not customer friendly.I recommend people not to buy this or any OnePlus device, because in such a situation you'll eaither be phoneless (during the period Amazon replaces it) or you'll have wasted such a huge amount on a defective phone, with no help from OnePlus.

"I was so confused in between S10+ and OP7 Pro because i was worried about weight and camera but both are excellent. I am glad that i opted OnePlus7 Pro. The moment i turned on the display i was simply amazed by its quality, seriously it's just pleasure to eyes to watch and feel this display.Other than this performance, camera, OS, and premium look of Nebula blue all are just amazing.Go for it and trust me you not gonna regret it.

"Highly satisfied with this mobile. You might have to adjust for a day or 2 with the weight and the size of the phone but eventually you will love OnePlus7 Pro. I had used Android , Apple and OnePLus earlier but the touch of OnePlus 7 Pro is sublime, out of the world. Popping up of front camera feels kind of creepy initially but you will get used to it quickly. After a month of struggle of selection between iPhoneXR and OnePlus 7 Pro i made the decision to buy OnePlus 7 Pro and am really happy with the result. Go for it, do not think.

"I'm upgrading from the one plus 2 and this phone is beyond what I expected of it. It's fast! The 90hrz display is butter smooth media consumption is a breeze thanks to the bezelsless display and the Dolby speakers which are loud and clear even outside. The performance is simply the best! No issues here whatsoever. Battery life could've been a bit better but it's completely acceptable due to the fact that it's powering a Mammoth of a screen. I'm close to getting 6.5 hrs of screen-on time and can get through a day with 10% at the end of the day with my usage. Camera is great it may not be as impressive as the pixel but it comes damn close I hope this will improve over time with software updates. If you're confused about picking this or the standard one plus 7 let me tell you I was too in that spot. But took the plunge and got the 7pro and after using it for over a week let me tell you the extra you spend on it is absolutely worth it the screen alone is enough to blow your doubts away. Unless you're strapped for cash consider getting the 7pro its worth it.Summing up:Pros1)Screen2)Dolby speakers3)Performance4)Price (still cheaper than other flagships)5)Premium Build.Cons1)Battery (Although acceptable for me, heavy users might find it lacking.)2)No Headphone jack or headphones provided. (shockingly no converter provided either.)3) camera (don't get me wrong it's perfectly good enough for average people and not a deal breaker but it's just not as good as the pixel.)

"I use 4 finger claw for Pubg and at random times the screen glitches for no particular reason. There are glitches of different type:1. Sometimes the place where my buttons are on screen, they get clicked even when my fingers are no where near it.2. Sometimes I have to have a finger tapping on the middle of the screen otherwise the buttons at the top left edges wont activate no matter how many times I tap.3. Sometimes buttons wont work all together.All these glitches happen at random. Sometimes the phone will be working fine and other times it just goes to hell. So playing competitive for which I bought such an expensive phone is defeated.Pros:Camera.Dunno, failed almost all my expectations.Cons:Pop up camera.Refer Pros.With no apps running in background and only wifi on 24x7 and no one using the phone, the battery last 2-2.5 days...with no usage. If you are using the phone with something like wifi or data or location (any one, never-mind two of these) on at all times, you are looking at at least one time charging the phone at eveningSincerely Disappointed,One plus user.

"I'll go through all points what's good, what's bad and what oneplus could've done better.THE GOOD-very good in gaming-very beautiful design to look at-very good & optimized software-very future proof-no overheating, throttling, etc-very good speakers (both clarity & loudness)THE BADPoor Screen protectorpre-applied screen protector is of very poor quality. It gets scratches sitting in my pocket within few days of use. I'm not sure it'll survive even a month and btw I am a person who take extreme care of my devices.Warp ChargerIt's very fast but phone feels slightly warm from back as well as front side while charging. i tried dash charger and there was no such problem. So, I am sticking with dash most times.Provided Covercover is ok. it's a bit on thicker size but not as thick as my 6t but ulike 6t dust, etc can get in this cover which is very annoying as I have to constantly clean it.Fanatic modeIt's not practical to use it as it blocks all calls, notifications, etc and don't even give us option to turn some of these things off. Gaming mode is fineA bit overpricedRobert Downy Jr, Amitabh Bhacchan, and other big stars are promoting this device and it looks like we're paying price for those big names as this device is not 14,000 different from regular oneplus 7IN-BETWEEN GOOD & BADCameraBack camera is hit or miss, sometimes it click very sharp and detailed photos but other-times it's photos are little on softer side and sometimes I felt that there's some beautification going on. But overall it gets the job done.Battery lifewith 90hz and QHD+ on battery life is average but with 60hz and FHD+ it's pretty even slightly better than my 6t, still battery life can be improved.About the sizeAlthough I prefer small phones and this is sure not a small one. It's very bulky but handling is ok you'll get use to it

"The phone is great. Few features are best in class like the display, processor, ram, sound is good but slightly tuning is needed to it, I think it is loud. Camera is good but not great and battery is enough for 1 day. Fast and adaptive os. I like the performance most. It's smooth, fast and no heating issues yet. So, for me, it is ideal phone. And really like the pop up camera, specially for face unlock.

"Overall nice phone.I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.I personally recommend OnePlus 7 because of these reasons:-1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.Some good things because of them I bought it.1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.2. Curved display.3. No notch.4. So basically I gave 20 thousand more for the sake of better or say best display in market right now.

"OnePlus 7 Pro is a mammoth.The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...Overall, rating hereBuild 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.Enjoy your shopping!

"Well what to say, Oneplus has killed it its own legacy. Previously known as flagship killer for better pricing... But now meh... Looks like Oneplus is trying to go as the likes of Samsung, and Apple of being EXPENSIVE. Overall i liked the performance, it's crazy fast, 90hz refresh rate makes the overall experience much better. Charging is super fast but, but the camera could have been much better, day light photos are good but when you try to take videos with the wide angle camera, it crops the frame. Performance is top notch, display is only thing I bought this phone. Super sharp and crystal clear QHD+ Oled display gives an immersive experience while watching videos and Netflix content. But battery life should have been improved from its last counterparts. On paper its 4000 mAh but because of the display that consumes more battery, it last atleast a day barely. Oneplus need to provide some serious updates for the existing bugs and need to improve in camera department.

"Undoubtedly it's a product for the rationale consumers who always wants to maximize their utility against budget constraint.It may be that even the famous reviwers also somewhere divided in their opinion regarding considering one plus 7 pro as a true flagship killer or flagship itself.But,as I am not a rivewer but as a massive user of versatile phones regarding brands and variations,one thing I must say after using it no one can stop themselves to make it a permanent daily driver at least for now,that is until something powerful will come in terms of phone.It's a beast with beauty.A beautiful wait balanced, mesmerizing display, unique haptic feedback,tactile alert slider,clean and wonderfully positioned stereo speakers,fast and furious finger print sensor,superb connectivity,sweet and smooth performance, considerable battery life, fantastic ram management, decent camera wrapped with unique and silky operating system and support of one plus community...uffff ...like Shankar Mahadevan's breathless song.No one can deny its overall overwhelming performance.Though I miss 3.5 mm jack but it's ok,I can manage it.But,the customers, specially the one plus fan feel more joyous if atleast,one plus provide a headphone or atleast a connector within the box.I also use S10 plus ceramic black and iPhone X's but even after having those world's best two gadgets,I must say salute to speed and never settle!<U+0001F618>

This phone is one of the best Android phones in the market right now.Pros1) Display is the best aspect of this phone2) Performance is pretty good3) Fingerprint reader is very quick4) Dolby stereo speakers is really good5) One thing I noticed while playing Asphalt game for over an hour is that phone didn't get heated up too much6) Battery backup isn't bad. Warp charge helps in quick charging of the phone for extreme usage7) Response time of front camera is pretty goodCons1) Phone is a bit bigger2) No 3.0 mm audio jack which could have been compensated with bullets wireless earphones given the phone's cost3) Camera hardware might be really good but camera app certainly needs improvement. This is my opinion after comparing images taken with S10, S10+ and also given that OnePlus ran ads claiming OP 7 pro being used in multiple photoshootsThis phone is really worth the cost except for the camera app which I think will be improved with the upcoming updates.

"PROS:1.) The first and most basic thing is OnePlus have always met the perfect requirement of a techie like me &2.) speaking about the price it's apt for what they have provided. People who are calling it pricey please use it for a week you'll find the difference. 3.)This one's a beast it can perform any kind of activity that the current smartphones can do.4.) Camera quality is awesome you can't expect a DSLR on a phone & don't compare it with all those apples or Galaxy s10s etc because your requirement is full filled UpTo the mark by a OnePlus 7 pro.5.) The oxygen OS is the most user friendly user ever.6.) Fingerprint sensor is in-display and it is best in class.7.) The front cam is a popup cam and it's not at all having any issues it's perfect it comes out and goes in lightning fast so no lags from the face detection.8.) Display is lit <U+0001F525> af ! Even in 60Hz it goes like buttery smooth then 90Hz I'm leaving to your imagination.9.) Buttons & Gestures are the top notch features of OXYGEN OS and you'll find them very very useful in the OnePlus 7 pro.10.) The nebula blue color is damn awesome it's really pretty cool sexy superb. I named it BLUNEY <U+0001F61C>CONS :1.) The one and only backdrop is that no 3.5MM headphone Jack so all your old headphones or earphones are going to be wasted or there is a requirement of a connector from type C to 3.5MM.This connector is missing in the box.& The suggestion to OnePlus is they should've given the connector or an type C earphones in the box because we are paying 58000 and that's the least we can expect.Also a display clean cloth and a 2 or 3 extras need to be added in box.To the people who are saying they are showing a cloth , a car charger , a Bluetooth earphones , etc etc in the advertisements or YouTube review videos, it's a review video or advertisement where the people are given a whole different box which is made for a review it's not a sale unit please remember thats their advertisement and review strategy !Still if you can manage with a type C to 3.5mm connector or a  type C earphones then other than that this one's the best phone I've seen. There's no other issue with it as of 1 weeks usage.

"One plus 7 Pro. An amazing phone. A real good upgrade from the Samsung galaxy phone which I was using for about 2 year (s7 edge). It's way ahead of these Samsung crawlers in terms of speed, performance, aesthetics, versatility and price. This phone is for power users. Very fast touch experience. Really fluid display and cool on eyes. Camera is excellent especially for low lights. There are lots of aspects yet to be explored but one thing is confirmed. This phone is a quantum leap in terms of speed and response. Too good.

Take my word for it  no youtube videos can show you the smoothness  that its 90hz display provides and is also a HDR 10+ display) Design - 9/10 ( The edges weren't really required but the still look really good) Battery - 7/10 ( the 90 hz display sucks alot of juice) Gaming - 10/10 ( by far the smoothest gaming experience i have had on a mobile device. I also own an iphone X and its even smoother than the X in gaming)All in all my only problem was the lack of a headphone jack and rest i am really satisfied with the purchase.

"The most expensive OnePlus phone yet and they definitely have done a great job. The moment you look at the 90FPS AMOLED you are above to fall in love and also will be main selling reason of the phone. It definitely beats iPhone xs in terms of performance and the smoother animations certainly helps. Gaming on this amazing display is a delite and all the games works really buttery smooth. OnePlus has also improved the haptic feedback on this device tho it can not match the level of iPhone but a good change is always welcome. The phone has its downside however, first the camera. I don't see any major improvement in the camera after coming from OP 6 I still feel its kinda the same although OP has this time around went with completely different sensor. Photos from the main sensor are great with great detailing tho falls in low light situation. The telephoto lens doesn't perform that great and found images to be washed out in most scenarios tho a software update can hopefully fix this. Finger print scanner is quick but it sometimes won't recognize the finger no matter what. Battery life isn't that great but with moderate use it can go for entire day of usage. Speakers are a much upgrade from last OP devices which is now stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos on board. Speakers however do offer decent feedback and can get really loud if thats what you want.Pros:Boy oh boy that display!Performance is top notch and is certainly the best performance phone in the market today.Price; considering how expensive phones have got lately I will say OP7 pro packs a lot and will certainly make users happy.Oxygen OS - I would prefer Oxygen OS over stock Android as it offers much more than what stock has to offer without losing the minimalist charm. Oxygen OS always have provided on top time software updates which is a pro in itself.ConsCamera's could have been better.Fingerprint scanner doesn't work properly sometimes.Speakers could have been better.OP should at least provide earphones in the box considering the price they are charging.

" I know this time people might feel this mobile is over priced by oneplus, but the features this mobile has, other companies like samsung or huawei might have priced it over 80k.Fingerprint reader is definitely faster that the 1st gen used in oneplus 6t. It is much quicker now.And quick pay is nor quich launch and we can set a no. of apps from which we can choose what to open which long pressing fingerprint rrader which unlocking and swiping to select app after unlock like paytm scan, phonepe scan etcCamera is another plus.The quality is great and telephoto is cool but needs improvement thought which is easily possible via software updates.Battery life what is get is arount 6 or 6 and a half hrs screen on time with quad hd resolution with 90hz. Yes both this settings will take a lot of battery but 6 6 and a half hrs for this setting is not bad. If we turn doen to 60 hz we might net few extra hrs but believe me one you are in 90hz it doesn't feel like going back to that laggy experienceOverall a totally worth mobile for the pricetag given by oneplus is is still a lot cheaper that what other companis might have offered.

Expectations were high but lets hope for the best for further usage..EDIT :  After 20plus days of usage and 2 updates working really fine and battery issue also resolved with some apps management. Now battery works upto 36 to 48 hrs for one single charge. Will update more once after i use it liitle extensively for few more days... Stay tuned!

"4000mah Battery falls very short when you keep your device in 90Hz refresh rate & keep Dual VoLTE on. So It will hardly last you a day (12-18 hrs max). Don't expect more than 3hr Screen on time.Again the fingerprint Sensor is in the display like 6t and so it is not very responsive..Worth buying or Upgrade?BIG NO!!!---Now coming to something very important that no blog or youtuber is covering because they don't want to be in negative books of oneplus PR persons....Cutting down the price and promoting 6T everywhere saying ""9000 Discount"" just before a week of new phone i.e Oneplus 7 and fooling the consumers by making an impression that the newer version will be costlier then 6t.Then launching Oneplus 7 phone at the same price (32999) and making sure they laugh on all the consumers who bought old stuff thinking they got a good deal but in reality they all got fooled by a company with #Neversettle tagline but, in reality, they ""MADE US SETTLE"" and left all consumers feeling cheated.#NeverSettle for OnePlus! Once a cheater always a Cheater!!!

"This is the first time I have moved away from Samsung as I have heard a lot from one plus users about it. I purchased it on 28th May as soon as Nebula blue was available. Honestly saying, I'm using galaxy notes since the launch of NOTE 1. I NEVER thought of opting out of note series. But believe me I have never used such a beautiful phone in my life. Although I have paid 50k bucks for previous phone.Keeping all pros and cons aside--This phone is A BEAST!! My favorite think about this is-- Warp charge!Com'on NO phone ever charges in less than an hour but it does. Whenever I go for bath it charges almost full and battery draining is not quick even if I stream live matches. Gone are those days when We had to worry about powerbanks charger plugs etc. I don't know about other reviewers, but for me it's totally worthy to spend 50k on this masterpiece.

"OnePlus 7 pro just feels so premium it just beautiful. The display is crispy <U+0001F917> overall very impressed. The battery could've been better they're already working on optimization! Good job OnePlus. Also great service by Amazon. Dispatched the product at night and delivered on the day it was meant to.

"This phone is awesome, but I can't really use my headphones right now because I didn't get a 3.5mm to USB Type C cable. I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues.

"Amazing performance. Gamers are gonna love this phone. I can't believe how incredibly fast the fingerprint scanner is.When it comes to camera, no words can explain its potential. With the right knowledge of photography you can capture amazing shots. In the pro mode it provides great features where you can control the shutter speed, iso, manual focus. You can check it out in YouTube.Coming to the display its very smooth. You can only feel the difference when you have been using your phone for a couple of days and then try to use your old phone.Battery life is good. But not that great. The 90hz drains a lot of battery.Theres tons of other things that make this phone great. Or else why do you think I would be typing such a long review.So guys, if you have around 50k budget, trust me, this is the one.

"Seriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer. Its been 2 weeks i have been this phone and started having problem with this.After the os update which one plus suggested 2 days back i have started having problems with this phone.During voice call other person voice is not clear always.Screen started hanging and many such small problems.Being such a premium smart phone manufacturer company i did not expect this issues from one plus.They always talk about the specifications and features but not about efficiency and reliability.Why such issues after every update.And i can not even see any difference after os update and update affected my phone's primary features.

"This is beautiful gem. I ordered it even after knowing of all the issues people are facing on it, I was little afraid but thank God I am not facing any such issues, no ghost touch, no battery drain etc. Camera might not be good for people who regularly use high end devices, but it's not bad. The overall experience is just amazing be it sound from speakers, the beautiful display and the smoothness of OS' transition animations, and ofcourse the new haptic feedback motor is amazing, it makes the overall experience even better. If you have money to spend, don't hesitate and go for it.

"It is my costliest ever phone and while reading couple of reviews, I was a bit sceptical on ordering.But finally ordered and a big surprise. I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent.. Pros .1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.5. Warp charger supplied with phone.6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don't obstruct the moving front camera.Cons1. Pricey.2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won't last long and will surely peel off soon.3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn't ships with even a wired headphone.4. Packaging could've been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.Desired.1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.

"I've been an iPhone user for more than a decade and this is my secondary phone. I'm writing this review after having used the One plus 7 pro for over 2 months. This is possibly the best overall phone available in the market if the price is taken into consideration.Pro:Good camera for recreational use. (Not for photography enthusiasts).One of the best refresh rates. Makes the entire experience of using the phone seamless.The screen quality is amazing.The phone feels well built and almost premium quality.No NOTCHThe OS is one of the best I've used. Closer to the original android.Curved screen and 90 GHz refresh rate make it the best phone around for video viewing.Unbelievably Fast ChargingCons:The camera is not at the level of other flagships. It tends to correct photographs too much. If you're looking to click accurate pictures its not the best one out there.The phone is quite heavy.

"Finger print reader is buttery smooth , camara quality is good but not excellent needs some more improvement. 1and half days of battery life. It depends on how you use the phone. If gaming is your priority it is smooth and fast but battery won't last long. Warp charger is fast . While charging phone heats up and automatically cools down at a percentage. By keeping in 90 Hz and resolution to auto switch it saves battery.The main flaw is no 3.5 mm jack, no type c to 3.5mm adaptor provided in the package .  Tempered glass not available for the phone in their website too.( If they are releasing a phone they should have accessories too but in OnePlus all accessories are out of stock). Price of the product is high. If they are pricing high they should have provided the adaptor for 3.5 mm jack , tempered glass and headsets in the package .

"I always have avoided oneplus so far just because how they call themselves flagship killer but yet miss on so many items, but with pro version oneplus has upped the game this year giving a tough competition to all the other flagships put there.Pros at a glance1. Worlds first phone with UFS 3.0, the phone is stupendously fast.2. QHD Screen with 90hz refresh rate, a very first on oneplus device. Once you get used to 90hz display all the other phones will be a joke in terms of scrolling performance.3. Great camera. Camera is great , though not to the level of many other flagships its great and there will gcam mods which will improve the quality.4. Stereo Speakers, again a very first on oneplus device, excellent quality.5. SD855 onboard.6. Warp Charge at 30W is sufficient enough to compensate the battery performance with 90hz displayCons at a glance1. No headphone jack.2. No type C to 3.5mm cable atleast.3. The phone is heavy.4.

"I would like to say that this is not an 'out of world' product as you see in most of the reviews. The one and most amazing aspect I like about this product is its display for which I would give 4.5/5 compared to iPhone XS Max display which would be 4/5 according to my experience.  In performance factor also I would say that this will be the fastest phone I have ever used. Apart from these 2, this phone is just like any other Android phone in this price range or slightly above. The camera is just an average component and cannot be called as a flagship feature here (except night shots are pretty amazing though). The size is also quite huge that its difficult to operate it with just one hand. Charging is pretty decent and would take around .1 - 1.15 hours from 0-100. Battery back is the same as that of one plus 6t which will last for a day with a full charge and medium usage. Overall I would say this is an okayish product but not an amazing product from the future.

"S10(+) vs OP7Pro.. I chose this since it's superior in the OS, Warp charge, SD855 gaming and few more. It also matches up with its OLED display to the major flagships out there. Battery life looks good on my device atleast, Charges blazing fast. UI with this display is buttery smooth. These pop up cameras are fun and sturdy. Fingerprint reader feels faster over the OP6t. Camera quality is not up to the DXO mark, but would be improved by software updates which are seamless on 1+ devices

V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k.

"Starting with the camera quality, the phone takes gorgeous pictures. Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can't stop just scrolling through your phone because it's so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo's wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones.

It's heavy (especially since I jumped from Oneplus 3 - 150g to oneplus 7 pro - 200g)4. The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I'm looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on. I haven't tried 60Hz yet thanks to the WARP charger.

All the functions of the phone works like a breeze.. no issues so far.. overall its a good phone..

"The OnePlus 7 pro is a large phone at 6.7 inches. It is heavier than you'd expect and is a little difficult to use single handedly. The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn't the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.

"This is my personal experience I am sharing. After 10days of purchase,  the phone got hanged during call, and the system didn't work for half an hour,not even power and reboot button.

After investing this big amount for a phone,  this kind of experience really gets you into trouble.Also,  would advice Amazon to extend return timeline and should give 1 month for these kind of products, as these are big investment for the user.

No IP ratingoxygen OS is very good. But I don't think that's the one reason you should buy it. My friend has k20 pro with Nova launcher and it's almost as fast as my OP7pro.Bottom line .. buy it for display.

"I ordered my OnePlus 7 Pro with lot of doubts in mind specially it not being water resistant and camera quality in previous versions.I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .Pro-1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.

"I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don't use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I've seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I'll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.

"The phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn't get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .

"Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.

"Just an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you'll surely love this device. The display is the best thing here, 90Hz refresh rate makes it so smooth to swipe... The phone no doubt is blazing fast..no lags or whatever seen till now. Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we'll I haven't seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won't get a defective one...Dash charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it. Don't see those camera reviews and all....OnePlus is improving them constantly...even I got a camera improvement update too...Soo I think it's the perfect phone under 50k

"Best budget smartphone in $700 price range. It is true to its class "" the flagship killer"". Only drawback i could find was that it is too large for single hand use  and battery consumption on daily usage although that can be justified by the presence of a 90hz display. Other than that a solid smartphone , feels premium in the hand with glass back and state of the art pop up selfie camera. I guess oneplus is living up to it's name and their motto ""Never Settle"".

"This is my first One Plus phone hence I don't  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It's a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it's not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).

"Better than Samsung M30,A30,A50,A70,mi note 7pro, poco f1, vivo v15, oppo f11 pro, one plus 6t and all other middle(under INR 30000).Also better than iPhone 7, 7plus, 8, 8 plus, xr and upper middle priced phone(up to INR 60000).Also ignore all other brand phones.Points:1. Camera is excellent, night mode is brilliant2. No lagging at all3. No heating issue4. Comes with warp charger in box, super fast charging5. Front screen is the curved and totally premium look. 6.67in Fluid Amoled Display (2340 x 1440 pixels, HDR10+).6. No bending issue. Solid body.7. Sceen is not bleeding. No problem at all.8. Android pie (v9) with one of the most lightest skin Oxygen OS 9.5.3GM21AA (lots of customizations possible)9. No network issue (mobile network, wifi, screen casting)10. Little bit Slippery back side due to glass body. You can buy back cover for that. Also Silicon cover is come within box, if you like it.11. Popup camera is automatically lowered during free fall. ie. If you are using your phone with front camera poped up, and accidentally you drop you phone, front camera will be automatically goes back inside.12. No bloatwares (only Google apps(can not uninstal), one plus' 3-4apps(some of them can be uninstall) and Netflix(can not uninstall) are pre-Installed.I bought one plus 1 back in 2014. After that no phone attract me to buy it. But finally made my mind to buy this phone. And so far, no regrets at all.Jumping 6 generation(from one plus 1 to one plus 7pro) is fun.Hope you also like this phone.

"OnePlus 7 Pro - A Better Phone (As they say)OnePlus has revamped its phone completely. Whether its Screen, Processor, Camera, or even vibration motor.Here is my review for the phone.The Nebula Blue color looks amazing but it will be available from 28th May. So i got the Mirror Grey. Initial impressions are highly impressive. You don't get a phone in the boz. You get a massive screen. A huge 6.7' screen with no notch, no cutout, Just full screen. Viewing media on this beautiful gadget without any restriction is a great feeling.Pros:Quad HD+ Curved Display. Its massive, Its Quad HD, It have 90hz refresh rate, And yeah its beautiful Amoled.Dual Stereo Speaker with Dolby Atmos. Super loud sound clarity.Snapdragon 855. Faster than your blink.Camera. By far the best camera setup of OnePlus. I won't say its better than x y or z bt yeah its a flagship level quality. U can click awesome pictures with good details. Video stabilization is simply amazing as always OnePlusUFS 3.0 - Guys it is a mad thing. It makes the phone superfast. Transferring files like snap.Battery. Its 4000mAh guys. You can easily get 5-6 SOTCons :Its huge. One hand use not possible.Its heavy.No type-c to 3.5mm dongleThat's all.

"I got my first OnePlus 7 pro after a week it's launched but the Pop up camera not working properly... so I requested Amazon and theyvsent someone for inspection. After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it's kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k....

"Awesome phone with great display. Camera quality is better then previous OnePlus phones, however its still not upto the mark of Samsung s10 or P20 pro. Also be aware that there is a price difference of almost 20k between S10+, P30 pro and oneplus7 Pro, so comparing their camera might not do justice. However it does fair pretty well, night mode is very good. Even though this is the most expensive model till date from OnePlus, its still has all the next gen features such as HDR10+, UFS 3 and so on which makes the price really apt. I love the curved display, unlike Samsung where you can visibly see the edges curved, in OnePlus the front display is curved in a grace full manner which later blends into the back panel.

"""WHICH PHONE SHOULD I BUY?"" Will be the common question of everyone today who are planning for the premium smartphone, especially with Snapdragon 855 Chipset.I think many of them have already written a detailed review of this product, OnePlus 7 Pro. But in this review, I want to focus on one issue of the current people, ""WHICH PREMIUM PHONE SHOULD I BUY?""Because earlier, it was a very easy task to judge the best, flagship, worthy premium smartphone - OnePlus. But now, it appears very difficult to select the best flagship smartphone. Because now we have so many options like S10, Note 10, K20, etc. to select. And even I was totally confused. But after buying and researching many premium phones, I am concluding things in this review.So now let us start to compare almost each and every premium smartphone with this OnePlus 7 Pro smartphone so that it will be helpful for you to buy the right smartphone.1) Samsung Note 10: Priced at 70000, less battery capacity, less powerful processor, smaller screen, no 90-hertz screen smoothness, no Quad-HD. So here OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner. You can choose this Samsung Note 10, only if your preference is a compact smartphone with S-Pen. Or else, please buy OnePlus 7 Pro itself.2) Samsung Note 10 Plus: Priced at 80000 (oh my God), performs less powerfully with Exynos chipset when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro's Snapdragon 855 processor. I don't know why Samsung doesn't provide Snapdragon chipsets for few countries for S series premium smartphones, even after charging 80k. And still same display - no 90-hertz smooth screen. And one more funniest thing, no 100% display. I mean, still, they are providing punch-hole selfie camera on the main display, whereas pop-up selfies are provided by other brands at just Rs.15,000 now. Come on Samsung! Even after charging 80,000, no pop-up camera? Kidding? So according to me, here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. If your preference is S-Pen alone with the latest premium smartphone from Samsung brand, please go for this and pour your hard-earned money.3) Redmi K20 Pro: I have used this. By paying 33k you will be hit continuously by MI dirty ads, for a poor quality AMOLED display. I hated this. No way match even for OnePlus 7. I can clearly tell that this can't even beat OnePlus older smartphones. Xiaomi should realize that customers are paying money for what they are providing. Earlier the scenario was different. Only MI smartphones were very much budget-friendly and ads were accepted (that too by some people). But now, showing ads is like totally killing themselves. OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. And I really don't see any good reasons why people should opt for Xiaomi phones anymore. Until they stop ads and spoil kids, I don't recommend MI phones to anyone anymore.4) Oppo Reno: I have used this too. Earlier I used to think that all AMOLED screens will be great. Because earlier, there were just Samsung and OnePlus to provide commonly AMOLED screens. But I learned from Redmi K20 and Oppo guys, that all AMOLED screens are not the same. These screens can never match even Samsung's entry-level smartphones' AMOLED display nor they can match OnePlus older versions' AMOLED displays. And moreover, what I really hated much was ColourOS UI of Oppo. My god! It is horrible I felt. According to me, here also OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner though Reno also uses Snapdragon 855 processor. Choose this only if your preference is high zooming of your rear-camera. Because Oppo Reno has 10x zoom while OnePlus 7 Pro's has just 3x camera zoom.5) Black Shark 2: In this 100% display era, MI, along with popping ads, is again lacking to provide the full display. This is a smartphone of having infinity display like OnePlus 5T or Samsung S8 and S9 series. So here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. Again, I don't see any good reasons to go for this smartphone.6) Asus 6z: This smartphone has failed to provide the AMOLED display in spite of being categorized as a premium phone. Very surprising. This itself enough to lose the competition I guess and OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. If the price is the only criteria, one can choose this unique revolving camera smartphone.7) Samsung S10: Again, I don't think it is good to pay a huge amount (61,900) for a smartphone with no 100% display in this era. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If a compact powerful phone is what you want, one can go for this.8) Samsung S10 Plus: Same goes here. My god...Samsung's pricings are too much I feel when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If superb camera quality is the only needed factor, one can go for this Samsung S10 Plus.9) Huawei P30 Pro: It is a known fact that Huawei and its sibling Honor was banned by the US for spying. And Android itself was expected to be killed on these phones. Though the ban is lifted for time being, it is not certain that the ban-lift will be permanent or temporary. So why should one risk in investing a huge amount on this brand? So I feel time waste in researching these brand's smartphones. So I prefer OnePlus 7 Pro only here also.10) Honor View 20: Same 9th point goes here.11) Huawei Mate 20 Pro: Same 9th point goes here.12) Google Pixels: Again, the Samsung theory goes here. When the era is of 100% displays, punch-hole cameras, infinity displays, notch displays, waterdrop displays, etc. are all meaningless I feel. So my choice is OnePlus 7 Pro without any doubts.So after researching and trying everything, I strongly feel that currently, OnePlus 7 Pro is the only model which can be trusted and you get more than what you pay.Frankly speaking, initially, when OnePlus launched this 7 Pro smartphone, I was disappointed by considering the price factor and the smartphone's size factor also. But now after using for a few days, that too after trying all other brands, I am really feeling that this OnePlus 7 Pro is worth for every penny you pay. Even the phone is NOT BULKY IF YOU USE A RIGHT SLIM CASE.The display itself mind-blowing and everything provided in the package is very, very powerful. All the three colors are beautiful - mirror grey, almond white, and nebula blue. Chose whichever you want. And feel free to submit questions to me. I will try to answer.

"Great phone and awesome performance.. Tested it with all kind of games and applications... Now without wasting any time I would like to share pros and cons :Cons-1. Average battery life (6 hrs SOT)2. Average camera quality (improved with the latest update)3. Dust magnet. I have covered Op7 pro with in box cover and also tried ringke cover but dust is all over the phone. Pop up camera also covered in dust.4. Side curves aren't the best thing in this mobile.5. Fingerprint sensor is not so good and responded in 2 3 attempts.Pros -1. Fantastic performer.2. Awesome screen. Loved the 90hz thing. Very quick in response.3. Nightscape mode is awesome after update. Compared with s10+ and difference are unimaginable. Op7 pro's images are better and clearer than s10+. You can see the difference of HDR+ images.4. Oxygen os is far better than stock android.5. Stereo speakers are upto the mark. Compared with other dual speakers phone and sound is clear and easily heard in crowded places.6. Using type C bullet earphones with this and get awesome output from device.In the end it is the user liking or disliking about this specific device. Some people impressed with the image quality and some aren't. Some people liked the sound and some referred it as a noise. Build quality is upto the mark. Tried it with water splash and phone is working fine. Pop up camera is not the feature a user can buy this phone for.Although i am using this phone as daily driver and it is the best device in this price range if performance is taken for the benchmark.

"Worst camera quality...... I thought I m getting the best phone but it's the worst one.... Plz do go for this mobile. With the amount of hype they made in media it's just a wastage of money. This is not a trusted brand to go for. Even I don't like to one star rest of the phone in the market will give the best phone with lots of features like vivo, oppo or Samsung. I raised a compliant with the tech team and will take it media for cheating us. I suggest all who are having the same problem take this to media in all forum, so that this company oneplus will understand and will do the needful. If not we have lots of ways to make them understand and return our money.

"Writing review after a weekPros :- Worth buying it.- Premium look and design- Lightweight and fast Oxygen OS- Display quality is awesome specially one can feel difference of 90Hz refresh rate vs 60Hz- Best experience for playing games and videos on QHD+ fluid AMOLED- Sound quality is best with Dolby Atmos- Battery life is really good. With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors. Hope this would be resolved in upcoming software updates.

"Bought this device a month ago and during first couple of days the phone was overheating while charging. Within a few days, one plus rolled out an update and after that the issue was resolved. Speaking about the pros I would say the phone justifies its price. The look and feel of the phone is truly elegant and no words for its sleekness. Some people may find it a bit bigger, but when you are in love with tech and ready to shell out 50k on a phone, these issues are negligible.Secondly, the display is sheer beauty. It's crisp and bright, and the difference is visible!I don't use the phone like a maniac, hence I get a full day backup on a single charge. And even if you are a heavy user, still a 15 minute charge is more than enough to keep you going for next couple of hours.The sound quality is also very good, thanks to Dolby Atmos.RAM management doesn't need any discussion. One plus phones are already prominent for their RAM management.Camera quality was initially on the lower side, but one plus has rolled out an update for that and, since, the camera quality has improved a lot.Lastly, the bigger screen paves way for a comfortable gaming experience.And now about the cons:The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow than the physical scanner, but the AI will get used to your fingerprints and overtime it will automatically improve. (Faced this issue was initially, but now it is quick as a Ferrari)Absence of headphone jack means shelling out extra cash for wireless headphones.No LED notification light. You have to check your phone so as to ensure you have not missed out on something.I am not a professional reviewer but I have tried my best to include my overall experience with the phone.Conclusion: One plus has, no doubt, used 'cream of the crop' ingredients to make this beautiful piece of tech. I don't have any regrets for upgrading from OnePlus 6. After all, you have to loose certain things to gain a better one!Peace.

It's just like a butter. Performance is always awesome in one plus and this takes one step forward with UFS 3.1. camera is a good improvement over 6T but still can't be compared with other flagship.I was little hesitant about pop up camera but oh boy it works awesome. It is a good implementation. Phone box doesn't include USB to 3.5m converter. Charging speed is awesome. Camera is good but requires some software optimization.

"One Plus 7 Pro is the  Best phone till date under one plus flagship.Well I think it has both Pro and Cons.I have listed them down as per my observation.Pro:1) Super Dispaly best in class and at this price.2) Battery backup is excellent.3) Camera is great please dont compare it with Samsung.Try the same in low light..4) Processor speed is superb with no heating issue .5)Quick charging and very fast clock speed.Cons:1) A bit heavy.2) No headphone jack.I had thought atleasy with this range of price they should provide us headphones and a Back cover.I think they have only reserved those things for Technical reviewers.If you see any technical review of the product they will get all accessories but a regular buyer won't.

"Oh my God awesome product!The screen is freaking smooth and nice build quality. Camera is better than any other one plus phones and even competes other cameras.Battery is bit on a rough side and is expected due to 90hz screen rate but it charges equally well and very fast.Loving it
            "
"What a phone. Totally worth every penny. The screen is the main attraction. The quality is out of this world just woowww.  The camera is good I won't say it's the best. But the smoothness is unreal the speed is unreal it's silly fast. And cherry on the cake is the wrap charger it charges your phone in no time. The look is classy and soft but still impactful.

"Been using this for 10 days.The display is excellent ( not as good as Samsung oleds but still a great display considering the 90hz and QHD panel.)Battery life is good enough for an average user, warp charging helps a lot when you're in a hurry.Camera is also good enough imo but it should improve via software updates ( you can still install the Google camera mod though).Performance is excellent on this one!! No lags or anything like.Keep in mind that this is a big and relatively heavy smartphone.Overall an excellent smartphone, but if camera is your HIGHEST priority, go for pixel 3a.I'm happy with my op7 pro.

"The product is simply awesome. One plus has surely  put a lot of work to make such elegent design and superfast device. The screen experience is just out of the world, its buttery smooth. Speed has always been the forte of One plus and Kudos to the team you wont even find one slightest of a glitch while using this device. Allso dont worry if you hate waiting for long hours to get your battery charged, the new 30W Warp charger does its job for you in no time. The camera quality is also decent and fulfills all your daily requirements. Overall the experience has been very good and trust me you wont be regretting your purchase, So if you are planning of buying one simply go for it.

"The display is just too good. I was unsure about the battery life because of mkbhd. But in my use I'm getting around 7 hours of SOT with 90hz and 2k resolution.Post camera update, the hdr issues have been almost solved.In my opinion the higher price is worth it, the other flagships at least in India are way too overpriced

"An amazing phone with everything you need.It provides an ultimate user experience with 90hz display everything is so smooth never experienced lag yet.Fingerprint reader is fast but 1 in 10 times it might not recognize your fingerprint and that's okay one can settle with that.It is much better than the gaming phones out there with fnatic mode and the display it is just perfect.The camera was good with some minor issues when i received the phone but after the update the camera experience has been alot better.It provides me a screen on time of around 5-6 hours  which is quite good because i am a heavy user.*All in all this phone justifies it's pricing*

"I am very happy with the product. But what's the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn't they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same.

"First of all, Let's talk about Negative FirstI should say that Oneplus Copied the Design from Samsung and This truly looks like S9 or something like that, its edge Display is the worst implementation, Overall Designiis good, but coming to Screen its really annoying why Oneplus opted for this. Who want a curved display..? If some one wants they will buy a Samsung.2. Weight if the product, it's really heavy this is also may be because if copying from Samsung.3. Warp Charger, it's to make us fools, really, when Charging Oneplus 6T and 7Pro, we surely notice that warp charger is another normal oneplus charger as both charges at same speed, what's the use of warp Circuit..? Still the speed is decent enough but not satisfactory for its name.4. Popup Camera, Of course Design wise it is an asset, but if Safety of Camera Considered then Popup camera takes out the points. If course they shown some circus tricks by weighing some stone to it, but they never shown how many times the motor can handle up and down of it..? If you use face unlock, that little thing pops up minimum 50 times a day and in long run.. Can it withstand..?Here Punch Hole Display is true Winner.Now coming to positives.1. Excellent Display, if we eliminate that edge Display fi a while and feel the 90hz Fluid AMOLED Display, then we really feel the smoothness of it, just like butter, and the Delivery of saturation, whites everything is natural and with vivid option it looks astonishing.2. Both Front and Rear Cameas work like pro, front camera gives pics with over Sharpness may be issue with resolution, but after processing they are good. Coming to Rear Camera, wide angle lens are not Doing its job perfectly, may be software issue, but still Potrait or normal works great, Quality is too good.3. In screen Fingerprint works really great, fast and no need to search for sensor.4. Battery Life, With Heavy Usage, 8hrs, with Moderate Usage,16hrs, with Normal Usage, 20+ hours and I got more than 48 hours of life with Light Usage. Battery backup is Decent when we combine all the draining factors like 6.6 inch Display, In Screen Finger Print, Quad HD Display, 90hz Refresh Rate and all.5. NO need to say about Performance, 855 processor says it all.Overall, It's a beast with some Drawbacks and I personally feel Oneplus crossed its limits by pushing its flagship killer mark to Flagship Competitor, Oneplus itself bought its destruction, sooner or later its greediness to takeover the market makes it vulnerable and make it extinct, I think this is my Last Oneplus Device as surely they will go beyond 60k from next mobile.They say some Quality Comes with a price to pay..My question is why can't this be applied to Samsung and Apple when Oneplus introduced Oneplus One..?Am writing This review after using the mobile for 4 days.Thank you.

"Phone is really good. Beautiful display and fast. One plus nailed it with this phone. Camera though is wanting a bit. Starts blurring when you zoom.The other big area of let down is the finger print recognition... It is very average. Many a times it doesn't even recognize the fingerprint. The face recognition is good but there is a little lapse as the camera had to pop out. This biometric aspect is no where close to the one plus 6.

"Hi All,Here below i have put some point about the One Plus 7 Pro (8GB RAM +256 GB storage) after using about 20 Days. I hope this will be informative for you.Pros1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it's far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects4) Vibration intensity is quite good5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally8) Storage is enough to handle your data9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast11) overall it's good product will not disappoint you when you will go for thisCons Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  ""S"" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn't provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that2) No accessories like earphones with the box3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(5) Now come to the software isssue- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven't cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that pieceNote : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer updateand i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it's team for this product. Such a nice product.

"I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.

"So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here's the layman review the kind I would've wanted to read here in the review sectionPro's-SCREEN- so good you'll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It's butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE

"Yes!!! After using this phone for around 2 months now, I have found it to be a pretty solid and a beast of a performer. The phone is snappy and pretty darn quick. The resolution is one of the best and the regular updates we get from OnePlus team is also admirable. Rest camera related opinions are always personal and not indicative of it's performance. Overall a pretty good option for those who want try out something new apart from the likes of The Samsungs, Huaweis..etc. No major or minor complaints.

"The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..

"Very bad service, Device started flickering after 20 days of purchase yet it was working for more then 10 days before it stopped all of a sudden, 100% Sure and gurantee that device was never ever close to any liquid, but then too service people said that device has water damage and I have to pay 17000 rs for replacing display.Pathetic and cheap style of earning more money like you earn in all different colour modules.Before I was proud to show my ohone to other people, now I got why iphones are better deal.50,000 is very hard to earn for a middle class person, I waited for this phone and buyed this phone by collecting 5000 every month from my salary of 25,000.I know phone is good, but the servie they offer is worst.

"Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.

"though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don't have enough inventory of the same.

"The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you'll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it's not necessarily consistent you'll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage. Absolutely worth the money

"I got a faulty product delivered and it was promptly repalced by the service center, good people at Chennai (Masood) and Bangalore (Anirudh) Service Centre. Overall the Phone is performing as expected worth the money spent. I am happy that one plus is backed by good service center executives.

"This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event ""FAST AND SMOOTH"". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn't really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won't mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the ""NIGHTSCAPE"" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it ""4 stars out of 5"". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. <U+0001F596><U+0001F596>

"Finally I could lay my hand on the Almost perfect high end smartphone,let me explain...Delivery-Superfast one day between the order and my possession, inference- I would suggest oneplus to be Amazon exclusive,they are doing their best for the buying experience of OnePlus products, actually I went to Reliance digital calicut they had no proper stock on the launch week and they were unware of any offers on OnePlus simply horrible experience.Unboxing-This is my first OnePlus phone my previous phone was Apple iPhone xs I was reluctant a bit before unboxing but boy I literally loved it when I laid my hands on this beast,few words from my initial experience,the tactile feel on the back of the phone is something which I have never experienced till date it's a sort of butterly silky matte gradient blue which you should experience to believe it,it's a hot looking phone specially in this nebula blue colour second only to oppo Reno ocean green which I feel is the hottest looking smartphone of this season,build quality is impeccable worthy of a flagship,few things about accessories Travel Adaptor is very huge will be a sore thing to carry around but charges at blazing speeds,Good quality flashy red data cable,an above average pausible soft back case which fits perfectly with some of not full protection,Some people had said in their review about airbubles under screen gaurd and poor application of the screen gaurd and all which had put worries in my mind but trust me guys it's so very professionally put which I would bet you can't get it done anywhere near it by a local screen gaurd vendor even upon microscopic examination I couldn't find any air bubbles or imperfections.User Experience-in just one word it's awesome,which none of the Android flagships could dare promising it to their fans at twice the cost of this phone,with just one update till date no issues at all, battery life is very good even after setting the display for 90hz,and boy 90hz display you should experience to believe it, scrolling,navigating everything is buttey smooth because of this 90hz,the fastest 256gb storage on any smartphone till date is blazing fast,Audio is good but not the best,Camera is again Good but not the best but livable,only one last and important thing I missed from OnePlus is the good quality type c earphone as I couldn't find a good qualityone on any online sites but no gripes,the pricing by OnePlus erases every little blemishes clearly to leave a Champion on this arena,thanks OnePlus and Amazon love you both.

"I have seen plenty of reviews with praises on the phone's hardware or the software. And both are awazing. An apple like integration of hardware and software. A beast at its heart. Enough RAM to handle multiple apps without a hiccup. No heating issues. Long battery life. Brilliant screen. What more do you need?My shout-out to the Oneplus team that is working non-stop on improving the user experience. In less than 2 month, I have received 4 updates that resolved a few initial bugs only cos they are listening to us and working on the feedback.Own one to see how they keep customers at the top of their priority list.

"OnePlus 7 pro is a beast of a phone.The 90hz display is definitely my favorite part about the phone, seriously a 90hz OLED pannel with hdr10 certification is just mind blowing.The performance is obviously not an issue.Alot of people have issue with how big the phone is, personally I still can use it one handedly it's not a big deal for me i've used huge phone all my life,but your mileage may vary.Also after watching YouTube videos don't hope for the bullets wireless earphones as they are sent as an promotional items to YouTubers to review and not for everyone.The camera is quite on par with the s10 as far as I can tell,unless you pixel peep you ain't gonna notice a difference.For the battery life I've been getting upwards of 7hrs+ screen on time or simply 2 day battery life as always you mileage may vary.Overall the phone is worth it.

"This phone competes with the big flagships at the cost of their budget flagships. Pretty decent camera, super snappy and fluid user experience. Fast in display fingerprint scanner and the battery life takes a hit at 90 Hz refresh rate but is excellent at 60 Hz. Also the warp charge is excellent. Oxygen OS is again very smooth being close to vanilla Android. Excellent Display, great camera, fast charging, powerful chipset should do your bidding.

"Love the phone.. Display is gorgeous. I am not very particular with the camera but still it's good in day light shots. Haptic feedback is very good. Easy to use the alert slider.While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it's only one time process and never felt the heat later.It's very huge and heavy. After using this phone and when used my old OnePlus 5T I could feel how thick and heavy this phone is compared to 5T which is so slim. I think OnePlus has to reduce the weight of the phone and also reduce the size to 5.5 inches fire another category of users.

"I was just as excited as anyone buying this model of Oneplus. It is very fluid but the screen difference is not that noticable. The system performs quite well and attention to small details make it feel nice. The OS as such doesn't have any new feature since android, i think is reaching its limit. So the performance tuning is wat is concentrated on and that has been adequately. Only major drawback i feel is in the department of the camera as it is not upto the mark. Initially at first glance it looks all nice and good, but the minute you start to zoom into it then it looks worthless. I wonder how DxO Mark rated it at 111??

"One plus is a reputed brand in India but this new product has really disappointed me. I had 3t as the earlier model and it was a wonderful phone from day one for me. I was so excited to use one plus 7 pro but apart from the phone's looks i liked nothing else. The camera quality does not match at all even with 6t. The touch and screen display cteates a lot of problem. On day two of using this phone, the screen suddenly turnee black. I was unable to unclock the phone or see any screen. All i could see was the clock display. And then the finger print sensors were displayed. I could not restart the phone as well for a long time. And i was traveling at that time which created a bigger problem for me. Compared to the price i paid, this phone is a big disappointment.

"I had ordered a Nebula blue one plus 7 pro. Received the device on May 31st, delivery was done efficiently, Thank you Amazon.The Nebula blue device looks beautiful. Good work Oneplus.From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):Pros:Everything in the news hold true -1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective. Go for it.

Got so many scratches after 2-3 days of minimum usage to the point where it doesn't feels like it was bought a week ago. Don't bother selling a phone worth 45K and no proper screen guard.Secondly, the touch doesn't reponds sometimes. I have to close the apps and then it starts working again and it's really frustrating.Thirdly, the Bluetooth stops working sometimes too when you want to share some files.Fourthly, the camera. It's not as good as I expected it to be. 48MP but the quality is not there. Shouldn't the pictures be more defined and detailed.

"Without a doubt this is yet another master piece from ONE PLUS. The only thing missing, which I think should have been included is the head phone jack. There are no cables in the one plus website as well and hence I had to buy one from a different vendor.Battery life is super good. When resource intensive apps aren't used, it can easily last for a day.Camera is better than previous versions.And the best add on is the stereo speakers. The list is long.

My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot's of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn't change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future.

"I bought OnePlus7 pro 8GB/256GB Nebula Blue on 13th June and upgraded (yes upgraded) from OnePlus5, which I used for almost 2.5 years. Before that I was using OnePlus1, So I am part of OnePlus community for almost past 5 years. Therefore, I have witnessed the journey of OnePlus in India from the beginning. Let's get into the details:1. Display - Amazing display with Fluid AMOLED and 90 Hz refresh rate. It is way better than OnePlus5 and OnePlus6 also. I haven't compared it with 6T. After using this phone for almost 2 weeks, I feel OnePlus5's display is dull and lifeless.2. Sound - The Dolby Atmos speakers are the best I have ever experienced in any phone. I compared the same with both OP5 and OP6 and there is a significant improvement in sound quality. The phone has speakers on both the sides but 85% sound comes from the bottom one.3. Battery Life - I haven't used the phone for extensive gaming; with moderate level of gaming (2 hrs.) and 3-4 hrs of screen time and 1.5 hrs of calling time it would easily give you 24 hrs. For cricket lovers, a full charge of phone will give you 70-75 overs with 70% volume.4. Camera - It is far better than OP5 and OP6, especially the low light clicks, but it could have been better for this price.5. Performance - I have never faced any problem with the performance of any OP phone and I am sure this phone will surpass your expectation.Downsides:1. It is very heavy compared to OP5, 206 gm, you'll feel the weight in your pocket2. There is no 3.5 mm earphone/headphone audio jack3. There is single type c jack for both audio and charging4. The finger print sensor is not as fast and smooth as the previous versions, but it has improved significantly after 2 system updates provided by OP. I hope it'll improve further with future updates5. The face unlock is quick but not quick like earlier phones, because of pop up front cameraThere are some teething problems, which I think we face with every new smart phone these days. I think, it would be sorted with future system updates. Overall, it is an incredible product from OnePlus and certainly the best one ever offered by them. I am sure it wont disappoint you and it would be worth every penny you are going to spend for this phone.

"I bought this product because of series name 7 earlier I was using Oneplus 5 since last 2 n half year.After usage of one month .. here is my view.1. Camera is not good as they have done advertisement.2. Warp charging very fast.3. Heating hanging issue while you are using Facebook Live or Facebook Messenger.4. Selfie Camera is poor.5. Not value for money it should be around 42000 maximum  .6. Overall if you are one plus lover just wait for price drop in coming days because sale is not good of One plus 7 pro due to lots of issues and performance.

"I have bought one plus 7 pro two days ago. This is the best product One Plus has made till date. I have bought 12 GB RAM and 256 GB storage.First of all I must thank Amazon for a wonderful delivery commitment. The day I ordered next day delivery however, it was too much rainy day. Hats off.I have given 4 star ideally should have given 4.5 out of 5 but no fractional marking.Pros...-Wonder physical look both back side dual tone nebula blue and front display really good with smooth flow over the edges. Also no non-sense notch. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>-State of the art processor snapdragon 855, 48 MP Sony camera ( triple) stunning AMOLED display.-Picture quality specially rear is good.-Battery average to good with high resolution display and 90Hz refresh rate and large display,  battery should have been 4500 mAH. Hope they will correct in 7T Pro.-Sound quality stereo speakers good.Cons...-Finger print reader requires full finger coverage not touch and go type which was a case for my earlier Honor View 10.-Biggest disappointing is that such a high quality product but such a cheap plastic cover? Such things are acceptable for 25k product not from a product have values nearly 60k.- No ear phone or even a type C to 3.5 mm converter. That I have ordered from Amazon. Hence could not experience real quality of listening to music.- No cleaning micro cloth- The charger is so big it covers the next socket area on switch board and when this phone is getting charged I cannot use next socket.-Selfie experience is not good, photos get heavily distorted on edges.- 206 gm a bit heavy on shirt pockets should have been below 200gms.- No expandable memory my old micro sd is now useless.- 12GB RAM does not give extra storage on devices, exactly do not know why 8GB and 12 GB cost difference is 6k. Samsung gives higher storage with higher RAM.

"This is my second OnePlus after using OnePlus 3 for a couple of years. Battery life is so good that I don't have to worry about charging the phone with extensive use. OnePlus lacks a lot when it comes to Camera performance, though 7 pro Cameras are much better than OnePlus 3, still they lack the performance expected of mobile cameras.Apart from the camera, it is a great phone to use.

"I have purchase 8 GB varient on 24-06-19 and within 3 or 4 days I found following defects :-1. Battery backup is very poor. It drains very fast.2. OnePlus claimed super strong conactivity, but according to me it is only satisfactory.3. Cost of this product is very high.4. I contacted customer care within 4 days of purchase for replacement. But they refused.So guys if you want to purchase costly phone. Think deeply about the negetive side. So please read all customers reviews carefully and then finalise. Once product received, you can't do anything.

"One major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for. Also amazon just replaces and doesnt allows us to return the phone. Never buy in my recommendation.......go for samsung note 10 instead......

"I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera. It's battery life is also just OK as I have to charge it on frequently basis

"Interested in returning and getting a refundA lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.

"Display is the best in the marketright now, fingerprint reader is as fast as you can imagine, games like pubg are extremely smooth and graphics are absolutely amzing. Oxygen os is just so amazing and easy to use and it's extremely fluid. Battery life depends on how much you use the phone really , if you use camera a lot or play lot of pubg then it won't last for a day otherwise you're good to go for one day. My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that's not the case. Camera is just average. Selfie pop up camera looks really cool and catches some attention and its better than the main camera. Nightscape is just a gimmick. So other than the camera , everything else is just perfect.

"After a month of uses...This is genuine comments as per mine uses of mine One Plus 7 Pro 12GB + 256GB Nebula Blue Edition.1. Build quality awesome. Premium looks and feels.Quite heavy but i feel like a expensive thing in my hand.2. Display is what I had expected. Smooth crystal clear.I am Samsung fan but at this time this mobile display impressed me.3. Lots of negative comments have found that battery is not good..But as per mine view point..it is lasting 3days.4. I am enjoying Dolby sound and loud.5. Face Unlocks is accurate.6. Flash speed charge 0 - 100% in 20 mins6. When I was purchased I was disappointed with camera picture quality. But after 3 updated now impressively changed my thought.Two Negative thing is that1. Fingerprint is not good enough. Becoz dust, sweat,or water will have on mine finger then fingerprint doesn't work.2. Expected wireless charging Technology will be here as per price.

"I waited patiently for a month to buy the Almond edition and by god it was worth it. The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus' point of view that it is better to do it properly.Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.Overall the best phone you can lay hands on.

"My first OnePlus phone and it's awesome. There is little weight that you might feel. Charging is super fast, you will never conplain about it. Camera quality is not that great as per its price but beauty is they are continuously pushing updates to make it even better. It's smooth. I don't play games at all so gamer u have no idea wabiut would you look in a phone. Battery backup is awesome. Just one concern, OnePlus needs to push security updates on time. Like it was already end of June when we got May 1st security patch. Gcam works perfect without doing any alteration in the system. Nughtscape is kind of ok till this update when I'm writing it. What else left? Yeah just one more thing, it feels little costly, but would give you great feeling of not owning that cheap version of crap which would merely last an year. So go for it and handle with Care <U+0001F609>

"I was so thrilled when i order and got this in hand. But after 2 weeks of full fledged use, this is my verdict. Overall usage of phone is good. Its smooth in operation, fast in processing. But i did not get the feel of the Pricetag it had..Camera: After using the Samsung Note series for almost  6 years, i was very dissapointed in the Camera.. Though they claim a higher PPi, the clarity of the photos are that pathetic for a long distance shoot as compared to a lower version of a Galaxy phone..Battery is not that great but better than Samsung. But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..  NOT WORT THE PRICETAG

"'nuff said. If you still have doubts, check the hundred or so review videos praising how good this device really is. If you are in the market for a premium phone but don't want to pay the Apple Tax or Samsung Tax, just got with this phone.Note: if waterproofing is not important for you, consider Asus 6Z as well for a much lower price.

"One plus is all about speed. The phone feels premium in hand. Finger print sensor super fast. Battery not that great due to 90 hrz display. One plus was never on the stage of camera quality but the camera here in OP 7 pro is not bad its not good nor great just some where between good and great. Over all the phone feels like a beast in hand.

"Writing this review after a month of usage.The camera is great and you can make it even better with GCam mods, Screen was excellent, gaming experience was seamless, OxygenOS gets polished with every update you receive, Sound was adequately loud, Battery life was good, fingerprint sensor was adequately fast in recognition however the face unlock works in no time, Charging speed is insane, network reception was also great, nevertheless the back(nebula blue) was awesome.Note : Do buy the Ringke Fusion X case if you are someone drops the phone quite often. I dropped my phone for more then 3 times and still the case protected it pretty well and also the case comes with a transparent back which shows the beautiful back of your phone.If you are in a dilemma of finding a case for OnePlus7pro then this would be a great pick.

"Been using it since launch, battery life is absolutely fantastic and so is the display. However, the camera or its software leaves much to be desired.If I cared about the absolute best image quality, I would not pick this phone. But I don't, and I agree with the majority in stating that no other phone has gone through a whole day with me (except perhaps the P30 Pro) and I would definitely recommend this phone.

"I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.

"Screen : It's really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage.. It depends upon your usage..Camera : I don't take selfie or photos that much, so can't comment on it..Performance : It is really really fast..Sound : I do watch a lot of my content on YouTube i do feel the speakers are not that clear.. They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash.. (It may be the choice of app i may use)

"Pros: 1. 90 hz (it takes you to another world)  2. Ui speed awesome  3. Charging speed mind boggling.  4. Haptic feedback best in class.  5. Sound quality of speakers awesome  6. A big thanks for the speed of phone.CONS: 1. Poor battery backup (battery drains rapidly)  2. Camera just an average (it kills originality of photos, make face a bit pinkish.)Don't know when one plus camera are going to justify it's price.  3. Handsfree/Bluetooth earpods sound below average. Didn't expected this from one plus.Tried different components handsfree /earpods same result.  3. Weight management very poor.  4. As phone is huge in size, functionality should be at bottom of phone. I hope one plus will do something.

"For those complaining  about display and camera issue. Trust this review.I've been an avid user of Samsung from the last 5 years and I've had all of their flagships. This was my first time with One Plus and I am surprised that it surprises me in all departments.. That flamboyant display with a cheeky 90hz is something ppl say is not noticable...Trsut me the absolute feel of that is beautiful.Gaming is undeniably the best from the best in this segment.Camera is great with the patches all of its issues are fixed and going forward many more patch updates will hopefully just make it better.. Stabilization is on point. The audio captured on the videos is great quality.Speed is absolutely is blazing fast... Yes it is going to face a challenge from the likes of redmi k20 pro. But it is a one plus end of the day and am 100% sure display is where k20 pro is not going to win. Also software optimization and camera is better any day on the op7 pro...Lastly, it is not about the best phone. It is about the brand value and what that can do as justice to the options you favor.

"The Good The OnePlus 7 shares the Pro's powerful processor, has a great battery life and comes with a more affordable price tag.

"I am writing this review after 9.5.10 update & after using it for more than 1 month.Pros:1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say ""ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e"" (Look at the display, it's shining), ""Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo"" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus's software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.CONS1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don't look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can't be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung's flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn't a deal breaker anymore.2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone's launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn't give an adapter worth <U+20B9>390 (manufacturing cost is <U+20B9>40) in the box of a <U+20B9>50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it's a fault of OnePlus not the phone.Edit : Today I bought oneplus's official audio adapter from their website for <U+20B9>439 (including shipping fee).3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don't need them.4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it's available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth <U+20B9>600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is <U+20B9>22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at <U+20B9>40k,though it's cheaper than samsung and apple's flagships.ConclusionMost of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won't regret.Final rating9.5/10

"Disappointed with Amazon delivery as I had to wait 6 days for the delivery of the device after making payment in advance. The wait was worth it. The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.

The fingerprint scanner is also fast and better compared to 6T and other phones having indisplay fingerprint scanner. The camera have been improved a lot from past models(I used to have OnePlus 5T and also used OnePlus 6T for sometime). The battery backup is fine if you are using 60hz and 1080p resolution it would easily last a whole day even after gaming for 1.5-2hrs and with heavy usage of other apps. Speakers are also good they are quite loud enough. Charging speed is also good ..it charges from 0-100% in approx 1hr 16min average.Overall really good device.

"I am using one plus 7 pro since the day it was launched in India. I am using the Mirror Grey version.I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn't matter.4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.All these are the Pros of PRO.Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D-  No headphones jack, they don't provide the C-type headphones connector-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock- Little heavier- Not that pocket-friendly

"It is worth it. Camera was not upto the mark before update, but it has improved a lot recently. And future updates will definitely make it a great shooter.Other than that you'll love 90hz display, Fast, clean and uncluttered UI, and overall premium feel.Only issue is it is hard to find good cheap tempered glass atm and there is no official tempered glass from oneplus available yet.Overall, it is worth the money.

"I am using this phone from 1 months must say this is the best smooth and fast phone i have ever used till datei think every one knows about its specs and looks so i dont need to tell about that allI just tell you about its brief battery lifeSo if you are going to use this phone for calls whatsapp and media consumption you will get 5 or 5 n half hrs of screen on time or you can increase a bit by lower the screen refresh rate and resolutionBut If you play PUBG in this mobile then it will give you max 4:30 mins SOT and if you use its fanatic mode then you will get 4 hrs of SOT if you lower its resolution and screen referesh rate then it increase a bit by 15 min or half an hours of timeYou will get Warp charger in the box which is 30w charger so you can full charge your device 1:30 hrsOve all its a gud purchase and after purchase i got 3 to 4 OTA updates and oneplus rectify its bugs and camera issues and lots of minor improvementsAlao if you are planning to buy this phone then buy one armoured case for the phone security aa phone is very slim and you can not handle without caseif budget is not your concern you can definitely go for it or else you can look for op 7ConsThe cons i have noticed is its weight,no ip rating and average battery life rest all looks perfect to me

"Great product.Snappy and superfast as u will expect from a Oneplus phone.Packed with the powerful Snapdragon 855 processor.Camera also excellent especially after update.Battery life surprisingly good and that Warp Charge is ultra fast.Display is best that any smartphone can get with 1440p Oled display and refresh rate of 90 Hz which sets it apart from competition.Gaming is the best experience with this display and powerful processor. Can play PUBG on HDR and Extreme graphics without any sort of lag. Too smooth.In display fingerprint scanner is the fastest I've ever seen.10 layer cooling tech works like wonders. Its nearly impossible to get this phone too hot. Even after long periods of gaming it stays cool.

"Bought this phone for my sister. As expected this is an amazing phone and has every feature one could expect. Battery life is almost a day (sometimes even more). Camera clarity is amazing. One thing I didn't like about this series is that OnePlus hasn't released tempered glass for it yet and every other tempered glass is just not good enough.
            "
"Overall experience of this phone is amazing, that display and the speed of this phone with that processor, refresh rate and Oxygen-OS work so well together, this phone is butter. Well worth the price tag, yes its expensive but it is not overpriced. Also got one year manufacturers warranty and 6 months of screen replacement protection plan. Lack of headphone jack and even the dongle is unfortunate, but I can look past it since I really love this device.

"This is a damn amazing phone. The video is as smooth as butter and you can somehow tell the difference between when it's running at 60Hz refresh rate and 90 Hz refresh rate. The 90 Hz refresh rate just feels much much cleaner and more absorbing. It is actually hypnotizing that's how good this phone is. You can use it for gaming and the visuals will be mind altering altogether. I was just playing Modern Combat 5 and wow what a mind bending experience it is. You can actually place yourself in the thick of battle with the chaos all around you. I have also played other games like temple runner etc. and they run like butter. Overall, very very very happy with this amazing phone and highly recommend it to anyone for any purpose whatsoever.

"This device is a beast. But please do consider that it is thicker and taller then previous generations.

"I am writting this review after extensively using this phone for more than two weeks. Let's divide it in pros and cons.Pros-1- One of the best feature of this phone is it's Display.  It's Quad HD display is one of the best in the market and at par with the likes of S10, iPhone series.2- The curved display gives a brilliant overall premium look and practicality to this phone. The curve is so subtle that it kind of flows in the phone and gives you a better grip.3-  90hz refresh rate is like you slipping I'm butter. It's is so smooth that you will feel odd using other mobiles. You can feel the difference as soon as you pick this phone.4- After the camera update all bugs are gone now and the picture quality you are getting at this price is brilliant and on par with likes of Samsung and iPhone. You just have to change the camera settings to get the best out of it. There are 1000 plus videos to guide you through it.5- Stereo Speaker, A person who has used One plus before will understand what a drastic improvement one plus has done on sound quality. It's is loud, it's is crisp and any audiophile will like it.6- Call quality. Cellular call quality and reception is good with this phone. There is no lag or anything with this device.7- Built quality- The phone is premium looking, well built beast. No flaws or air gaps you can find and it gives you an confidence when you hold it in your hands.Cons-1-  First I have to right this. There are so many reviews for this phone giving 1 star and stating that they have seen on YouTube that it comes with a headphone and they didn't receive it. I mean this  is heights of stupidity guys. Firstly, in description only it is clearly mentioned what all comes with the phone and secondly youtubers get a review unit which is totally different from a retail unit. One cannot judge a phone on this particular thing.2- Battery- So you have a big battery here and with a moderate to heavy media use it will last you to 12-14 hours.This includes 2-3 hours callingSocial media consumptionStreaming sites consumption ( as World Cup in going on and we want India to win)So, battery will give you above average use but it is definitely not bad. Morey, one can change the 90hz refresh rate setting to 60hz and Qhd to Hd setting if you want more battery life, but again what's the fun here.3- 3.5 mm headphone jack- So I was one of guys who was really disappointed with this move of removing 3.5 mm jack. But, after getting this phone I got good Bluetooth headphone and I understood that what I was missing. Sound quality wise the opinion is divided among people as some say you get better sound quality over Bluetooth and some say it is better with 3.5 mm headphone jack. But, the kind of freedom you get with wireless device is way way better. And after you get a wireless earbuds or headphone you will understand that it is way better than wired ones. So, personally this is not a con for me now.4- weight- Phone is definitely heavy when you compare to other phones. But, you will get use to it. And after some time you will feel more confident with the weight of this phone while handling. It is not an issue.Conclusion- So one plus was a brand which use to kill the flagships of the year and now it has created a flagship of its own. We should understand this that usually a flagship phone which we get from Samsung or Apple at 70-80k, here we are getting it for 50k. This phone gives you all the premium features at a lesser price than its competitors.So, if you have a budget of around 50k. You should go for this phone without even thinking twice definitely it's flagship of the year with the price point it comes. Just go for it guys!!!!!!

"Nothing better if your budget is around 50k. The display and design is just gorgeous. Oneplus is a brand which can be trusted.  For the 2 months that I have had this pjone i have received like so many software updates. That says a lot about OnePlus's dedication. You can't go wrong with this phone. It checks all the right boxes. The camera quality is steadily getting better with software updates.

"I have been using this device for the past 20 daysand I'm totally impressed with it.Onepluss 7pro is the fastest and smoothest android phone i have ever used. It really impressed me how smooth it is.In performance department it was the best and no doubt in it.I am not actually a camera guy but photos which i am getting are pretty decent.Coming to the battery life, it's not so good. Decent battery life which can last a day for normal usage. Charging speed is really excellent.Display is one of the best but not ""the best"". Color accuracy is not on par with s10 plus but close to it. Though i would prefer oneplus 7 pro's display since it has no notch and 90hz refresh rate.Sound quality and haptic feedback is greatly improved compared to it's predecessor and on par with the flagship devices.Overall its an ultimate performer with best display and sound.

Over all very satisfying experience with this product. Well done OnePlus ! And I still miss the headphones jack !

"A killer flagship !!Display is out of the world with this 90hz panel. It feels buttery smooth.The warp charge is mind-blowing. It could get me to a full charge in an hour.Finger print reader is pretty accurate and also the pop up face unlock is a head turner.Audio quality,Call quality,Video quality,Ram management,Network Coverage all are as expected and is perfect.The camera is kind of good, I mean the primary 48mp and the 16 mp pop up camera are great to use, but the wide angle and telephoto do need a lot of improvements. The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don't know if that's much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it's obviously worth it. Add a warp charge that can give a full charge in about an hour, a very satisfying haptic feedback, a definite head turner popup cam, triple cam setup and it's very much a value for money flagship !!

"Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro <U+0001F61B>) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors.

"I didn't find anything that appreciable in this phone other than it's premium look..I have been using this phone since 3 months and I can say that buying this device is really a waste of money. The scenario becomes more worst due to its poor backup and fast battery draining..could you believe that it's battery dropped to 20% from 70% in just one and a half hours. I needed to charge this phone multiple times a day, the wrap charger gives some relief for it charges super-fastly. If I talk about it's camera quality, it is just average..often the pictures get blurred and I don't understand why the hell it is so.. Absence of ear-phone jack makes the situation more worse. Finger sensor too often not works..I needed to put finger 3-4 times then it recognizes the finger..I haven't expected such a low from one plus, a higher version should have greater experience ..but such a premium phone in such a premium price has been proved a waste of money..I m really disappointed with this phone..

"I am using this device for around a week. These are the things I came across:1.) Display is very big. It is okay for me but single hand operation will be difficult if you havent got big enough hands.2.) This device is heavy. Again for me the weight was okay but it might not be for u.3.) Low light camera performance not amazing.4.) Otherwise camera performance is very good.5.) RAM management is excellent .. didnt come across any lag issues or frame drops while playing.6.) Charges really fact and have a good enough screen on time(for me).There are minor issues which i believe they will fix with upcoming updates and YES they either should have provided a headphone jack or some connector for my wired headphones. This is expected as u are pricing something around 50k and also not proving wireless charging and waterproof certifications......this is kinda upsetting.But yes it is a good device. It will give you the best performance and yea looks amazing. Except that jack issue I dont have any other complains.

"Camera quality is awesome, specially the nightscape mode. Pictures in night are much better than any other phone. Fingerprint read is also good just the thing that sometimes it does not detect may be due to lots of fingerprints on screen cover. Battery life is really great. Once charged you can use it throughout the day.Display is really awesome specially the infinity display. All things look much beautiful in one plus 7 Pro becz of such good display.I think one plus should have provided headphone jack connectors, as there is slot for it and we are able to use one plus 6t's connector, so there's no use of not providing the connector, or else they should provide free Bluetooth earphones.

Don't just fall for youtuber's saying camera softens pics or there is oversaturation or speaker isn't good enough or the fact that fingerprint sensor isn't fast because it is fast...Everything in this phone is straight up great the display, speaker, camera, speed everything except for the wide angle camera.. which is good at best because when you switch cameras from main to wide the saturation brightness contrast changes  with the later being a bit washed out... While takin wide angle pics of a building and scenery is just great.. the wide angle picture of a person withe the scene in background is just pathetic...there are distortions like the limbs of the person become longer (yes you read that right) the skin tone is straight up washed out... Updates haven't been able to fix this yet but apart from wide angle camera this is worth the extra bucks

"Best in class than compared to other brands for the same specs, many bugs are solved on frequent updates and hope camera quality also improves with future update.Finger print reader is fast and simply amazing.Battery life is good, the best thing is warp charge. So any where you are get it charged within 20min and more than 80% of your battery gets ready, for safety purpose get yourself screen protector for the phone first, since the display is one which gets affected in case of any physical damage. Hope the after sale service is also good by oneplus.

"Camera quality is very poor. Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter.

"The most beautiful phone i have ever seen.The thing which makes it more attractive is its screen (QHD display with 90Hz refresh rate!!!!) The best display i have seen on a smartphone. And the other two things which i loved about this phone is the haptic motor and the Warp charge.Overall this phone ia worth every penny you spend.My friend bought Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and we tested out which fone is better, and there was doubt that OnePlus 7 pro is the clear winner.Thank you OnePlus for such an amazing product.Proud to be a part of OnePlus family.

"No doubt at present it's the best phone available in the world. At first I thought it's a bit costly but after using it for a month take my word it's worth every penny.I will not mention the features as we all know it, but it's really super fast, the touch is excellent, display has no match and it is super smooth, battery can easily last for full day even with heavy use and the wrap charger fulls it very quickly. Finger print reader has no match, it has great camera with some great features, very good quality even in low light. Friends Oneplus 7pro really is a great Masterpiece by Oneplus.Those making mind to buy but are a little doubtful........ take my word, buy it with closed eyes, you will Love it. Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery.

"I have nothing much to review it - it's a beast and amazingly fast, it has a neat pop up camera and the triple rear camera take decent photos, it is a best value for money smartphone in premium smart phone range. The vibration motor is pretty amazing and typing feels to a next level when you have suddenly upgraded from one plus 3. The on display finger print is fast and doesn't Lags in any way or the other, and finally this almond coloured variable has its own premium look.

"This phone is best till date from OnePlus.Camera quality - 4/5Battery life - 3.5/5Display - 5/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Performance - 5/5The 90 Hz display is just awesome but consumes more battery, and it's worth it. Camera could have been better but I'm overall satisfied with the camera because I believe it's not about the tools when it comes to photography.The infinite curved display with stereo speakers give the best viewing experience when it comes to watching movies / series on the phone.Simply, go for it.

Auto brightness may help in broad daylight but may burn the oled with prolonged periods of usage.Rest is all good performance, speakers, charging.No heat issues even with full performance gaming.Included case is very cheapish in appearance.

"Display is awesome. Buttery smooth touch. Samsung's display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb. Battery backup is below average for the price you are paying for this device but super fast charging makes up for it.

Device look and feels really good, the glass back is awesome.3. Battery life is good and the warp charging is insanely fast.4. The brightness, sound quality gives a perfect movie viewing experience.Cons:1. The device is heavy, you might find it difficult to mount it on a lazy handle too.2. The Indian variant lacks 5G. So you might have to upgrade the phone in couple of years.3. The back cover is textured and blocks the color of the phone. Oneplus could have considered a transparent back cover.

Camera is good but the main thing is display. Best display in market right now. Amazing sound quality. No comparison in terms of performance and charging is amazingly fast. Only drawback is regarding the notifications i.e. there is no AOD and notification LED so you have to wake up the phone each time to check whether you have received notification or not.

Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.

"After using for a couple of months, the phone has started hang at moments and to my surprise being such a premium product it has the worst fingerprint reader I have ever experienced. At times you might get fed up of constantly replacing your finger so as to when the damn phone will read it correctly. In terms of camera there can't be a better competitor to this phone, it's just awesome. The battery life is also ok but not up to the mark.
